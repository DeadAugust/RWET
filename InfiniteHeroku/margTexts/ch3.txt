chapter three a second opinion

on march 1st i got to get out of the hospital/hell after being there for three weeks . so lots of people came over and i got to see my new born baby cousin Payton anne . i was really loving my house and all my family and friends. about two days later i left for houston for a second opinion . well a very generous man let mr and my parents fly in his private jet. lete tell you flying commmercial after that is just dispicable. we were there for a week and saw many doctors in M.D Anderson, which by the way were all women except for the radiologist. I met with a stem cell doctor and she said that stem cell transplant was an option . i would have to go back in a couple of weeks and give the stem cells and when i needed them i would get them back. the day before i left for houston i shaved my head so i looked like G.I Jane so of course when we were there i rubbed off all my little hairs and i was perfectly bald and looking like a real cancer patient. this was a big reality check for me.
