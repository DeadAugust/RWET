       "\"ELEGY\\n\\nWe were the ones slow-dancing with streetlamps, fashioning gallows out of bottle and bone, we were singing from the tops of pines, the birds didn't know what to make of us and our scramble towards the sky, we were building walls in the backyard and knocking them down the next morning, on the metro we were always swimming in pools of our own sweat, on midnight treks for smokes we caught rain on our tongues and carried it back home, we were cages of light barreling towards the gutter, the only place we fit, our mating calls resembled quarters in a blender, our path was marked by the string of baffled dog catchers and gas station receipts, the candy in the freezer was not candy, the burns down our arms were not from the stove, the 40s in the recycling were stained with lipstick and piss, we were pipes bare save for resin, we were busted chainsaws, fences full of holes, we were the mad ones, our pockets full of rattlesnakes, our mouths full of cement, our pals were the garbage men and ghosts, we were the haloes around headlights when the sky cried mist, we were white-knuckling on the freeway while earthquakes shook the streets, we were twilight cathedrals crumbling and cold, we were weeping on the pavement when the blackout fell like snow, and we woke up from our dirt nap, in new alleys, all alone.\\n\\nTRIGGER WARNING\\n\\nHere is something that is true: at some point in broad nightlight\\nyou'll shave your pubes before going to a party\\nand end up ladling in a soup kitchen instead.\\nOne time on Western and Expo\\na guy hyped on PCP charged a cop car naked,\\nlike maybe if he smashed the dash hard enough\\nhe'd break the windshield and not his hands . . . but he was wrong,\\nand we watched him hit the pavement and sob.\\nHe was Tank Man in South Central, but the cops didn't care,\\nand neither did we, really, since we just blinked and walked away.\\nAnother time I stopped outside a sorority house\\nbecause a girl was at her window; it was dark, she was applying makeup\\nviolently, which I hadn't thought possible, and I don't think she saw me\\nbut I waved just in case. My friend Wilbur\\nsaid smoking helps you hike at high altitudes because your body\\nlearns to deal with less oxygen, so maybe if I lock myself\\nin a gassed closet, I'll figure out how to navigate my sex life\\nwithout smothering in the sheets. Here's a weird one:\\nI punch myself when I'm anxious and nobody's looking\\njust to take my mind somewhere else, and I must confess,\\nit works. I don't know what the deal is with all these\\nstreetside cathedrals, but they're creeping me out,\\nand it's not like I have anything new to say about God or sex,\\nbut I'm still talking. I've learned that if you want to be left alone in public\\nyou just have to curse in creative ways, like fuckshitfuck!,\\nand wear clothes with holes, but if you end up in the wrong neighborhood,\\nlonely strangers will stick to you like glaze—like last Friday\\nwhen I found myself handing a smoke to a bald gangbanger\\nwho gave me girl advice for a good twenty minutes\\nat MacArthur Park. Most of it was just him complaining about his ex\\nand his dismal sex life, but the dude meant well.\\nSo I wish I knew what to say about gin stagger and needles,\\nor how to forget an ex's perfume, but I don't. My sermon is\\nZippo tricks and love notes written in wine,\\nmy friends are my bruises, and I know I taste like nicotine,\\nbut everybody tastes like something.\\nThere was one time on Western and Expo when a man got really scared,\\nand rather than let anyone notice, he shattered his fists\\nagainst a checkered dash. Later I saw a girl plaster her face\\nwhen she was beautiful already,\\nand then along the lake known for body bags and ducks, I shared a cig\\nwith a guy about as lonely as me. Here's the truth: at some point everything ends,\\nand the streetlights turn off, usually because it's bright enough to see.\\n\\nCURBSIDE DIRGE\\n\\nHow sweet it is to drink too much coffee\\nand smoke under the manic flatness of streetlamps\\nwhile cars drive by and police choppers float\\noverhead. I wonder if it matters\\nwho's on the pill, or who's taking Prozac\\nbecause they can't stop staring at bridges.\\nLast night I slept in the library, watching\\ndrunk students wander the quad,\\nlaughing, tripping on boards and empty cans.\\nI wanted to hear what they were saying. I wanted\\nto follow them home and listen as they drunk-dialed\\nexes and slurred pleas for them to come over,\\nmaybe catching dial tones, maybe having clumsy sex\\nthey wouldn't remember.\\nSometimes I think we're kidding ourselves when we say\\nwe know what we want, or whom we'd like to fuck,\\nor how many times we've been talked down from rooftops\\nby loved ones. How lonely it is on the freeways\\nwhere everyone is in sight of each other but so\\nout of touch. How strange to see friends with razors\\nand burns under their clothes. It doesn't matter.\\nI can fall in love on the metro or on the moon\\nand I'll just end up on this same dusty corner, blowing smoke\\non strangers as they walk and keep walking away.\\n\\n4AM, TUESDAY\\n\\nAt 4am, the only commercials are for call girls,\\npenile stimulants, and animal rights campaigns.\\nAn occasional Discovery Channel documentary. Maybe a sitcom. \\nSo many people tossing their remotes and touching themselves,\\nin beds and on couches across the slow blue land,\\ndisregarding their open curtains\\nand piles of unwashed clothes. This is all to say\\nthere's a lot of sadness in TV dinners\\nand drinks left out overnight, long enough for moths\\nto get curious, drown and get tossed.\\nI feel like that octopus\\nwho figured out how to open a jar underwater\\nfrom the inside, and instead of swimming out\\njust sat there, sort of looking around.\\n\\nIMMOLATE\\n\\nLet's go out late tonight, palming fives to beggars\\nand inscribing lines in every oak we pass, paying\\nno heed to sirens or stares. Last night was only\\ncheap beers alone at the bar and stumbling home,\\nsidestepping strangers and ghosts, breaking in\\nthrough my own window because I dropped\\nthe keys in some alley. Let's not over-think this:\\nlet's put a little something in our orange juice\\nand dance in the graveyard, belting out\\nhymns and hip-hop, as if they're the same thing,\\nand people will notice the stench of fear\\ndisguised as elation, and they'll come out looking.\\nLet them come. Hell, let's call up\\nthe mayor, the plumbers, the baseball team,\\nwe'll take that graveyard and turn it into a rodeo,\\na firework show that just won't stop, and when the alcohol\\nfinally runs out, leaving us gasping and faint, we'll find\\ncar batteries or antifreeze—anything to keep us going,\\nso blast the music, pour me another shot, come dance\\nwith me here in this room with no windows or doors.\\nLet's try to ward off our exes and the dead—let's light\\nourselves on fire so the last thing we see is bright\\nand warm and alive.\\n\\nAPOCALYPSE\\n\\nThis is my hand, this is my fist, this is the sound\\nit makes against cartilage, on the dance floor or\\nin the chapel, and this is the way it cradles air\\nit's too scared to release. So what do we do now\\nthat the foundations of our homes have splintered\\nand the unions are on strike? How can we\\ngo on when we keep eating our own fingers\\nin our sleep? I was thinking about how this\\nis probably the end, soon the sky will fall\\nlike a sheet of glass and the sea will boil away.\\nThis is my hand, this is my pen, this is my poem\\nabout the Apocalypse and how maybe\\nit's already happened. This is the stale gray of the ER\\nand the warm drip of pills down your throat.\\nThis is my therapist, and her cute dimples,\\nand her wedding ring. These are mud dauber wasps\\nparalyzing spiders, stacking them eight or ten deep\\ninside their nests for their larvae to eat once they hatch.\\nThese are thin spider legs folded like Kleenex, in neat\\nlittle piles, and that's us, in our houses and cubicles,\\nin our relationships and fragile skulls.\\nThis is depression, this is a prescription, this\\nis the realization that the world will be just fine\\nwithout me. This is desperation. This is a love note.\\nThese are my lips. Those are yours.\\n\\nAMERICAN SPIRITS\\n\\nAnd the worst part was she'd only had a bottle and a half\\nwhich isn't much for her, and I shredded my soles running\\nonly to find her slumped on the porch with a pack\\nof American Spirits on hand. She cried out\\nall the alcohol and told me about her mother, how to mix\\na French 75. I pitched a dozen Valium across the lawn\\nto make the cats feel a little less empty, a little\\nless like spiders stuck in Coke bottles, left\\nto rot. We ordered gin and tonics at Denny's\\nand snorted coffee onto the rug. I know another girl\\nwho is sad all the time, who smokes weed\\nand used to slip her hand into mine\\non walks through golden hour haze. When I left her\\nshe talked about barbiturates like old friends and gave me\\na fistful of well-conditioned hair. She once said, I'll kill you,\\nI'll fucking kill you, I love you so much, in plumes\\nof pillow and smoke. Now it's the three of us on our own,\\nbalking at prescription pads and chain-smoking\\noutside parties, spitting in gutters\\nto keep the currents strong. It's winter in Los Angeles\\nand the trees keep tearing up the sidewalks. People notice\\nwhen you've been crying but they rarely mention it,\\nand hordes of feral cats flood roadways, saying, Hit me,\\ndon't hit me, please hit me, do it now. There are times\\nwhen the world feels like a scar\\nand no smog can satisfy these trenches in our lungs.\\nWe're jigsaw diagnoses and mounds\\nof flat tires, and our friends worry because\\nwe haven't been smiling or answering their calls, and they're right,\\nsomething is wrong, but we'll be the first to admit. It's 3am—\\ntonight I'm alone in the Culver City Denny's, wiping coffee\\nout of the carpet and setting every other smoke aside.\\nI am not holy. I hold my vices like a crutch.\\nI'm still wrapping my knuckles in barbed wire,\\nstill helping loved ones dig their graves.\\n\\nCLUTCH\\n\\nThe ice grips the coffee\\nlike spray paint holds a post.\\nWords are clingy shadows\\ndrawing the ear\\ntowards wet lips,\\nwhich is to say\\nthey keep us apart.\\nI've been watching strangers\\nthrow gazes in bars,\\nfluent in dog whistle talk\\nonly the walls accept.\\nIn the diner all the mugs\\nstacked in clean rows\\nare more grave than gravestone.\\nI like a cold stout\\nbefore anyone has wiped the foam—\\nthrough the amber flow\\nI can't tell if I'm looking in\\nor a stranger is looking out.\\nAn exposed belly\\ncradles the end of a screwdriver\\nmuch like a vice grip\\nholds a tongue.\\nThe only reason I feel secure\\nis that oil bleeds in rainbows\\nand scars don't peel away.\\nI remind myself\\nblood ambles veinways\\nonly as long as it must.\\n\\nSTARS\\n\\nToo much caffeine too late at night has got me doing handstands\\nin my brain, trying not to dislodge neurons or knock over\\nstacks of cans. I want to go outside and punch anyone\\nwho looks me in the eye. I'm joking. I want to punch\\nmyself in the eye until my face is half raccoon and half\\nhomeless beard. If I sound like I'm scared\\nit's because I am. I've been talking to God nonstop\\nsince I had that dream where for a moment I forgot\\nmy name but I haven't gotten a response.\\nOnly shards in my soles and that truck full\\nof manikins that drove by and felt\\ncrucial—like maybe I could take one of them out\\nfor a drink and learn something\\nabout what it's like to be drawn and quartered,\\nwhat it's like to be stared at nonstop for hours.\\nI want to be a manikin. I'm joking. I want to be\\nsomething other than this fleshy mass of nerves\\nsquirming too fast to fit in my own skin. While everyone\\nwas out sipping wine and playing charades, I was in the dark\\nmixing cocktails out of beard hairs and dirt. I'm joking.\\nI was in the dark talking to God and waiting\\nfor someone to remind me of my name, to apply ice\\nto my eye and say, Listen, we're all dying. Why not do it\\na little more gracefully? The stars feel colder\\nwhen you shed your liquor jacket and watch them\\nnonstop for hours. They laugh like they know something\\nyou don't. They want to destroy you. They want you\\nto hurt. I'm joking. They want to remind you\\nthey're already dead.\\n\\nVITAL SIGNS\\n\\nHow many heads can you fit into one oven, wait,\\nthe better question is how many can you pull out\\nin time? I found my friend making a gin and antifreeze\\ncocktail but before I could slap it to the ground,\\nI heard my roommate waterboarding himself\\nin the bathroom. All the nooses have been cut,\\nall the knives hidden away, but still we find ways\\nto self-immolate, to choke on our tongues, to kick\\nbuckets so hard we break our toes. This is going to hurt\\nfor a long time, I told my friend as I punched him\\nin the jaw, with just enough force to knock the pistol\\nfrom his hand. Let the ambulance come, let the pills\\nand whiskey flood the toilet and not your veins.\\nTake those veins and wear them like a coat\\nof many colors, far more blue than red, far less\\nsedated than alive and living, yes, living, despite that\\nwe're all dying on our own terms. When Renee died\\nshe did it in her wheelchair amid piles of scrap metal and trash.\\nI caught myself burning a hole through the back of my hand\\nand with that hand I punched a hole in the fence\\nso my friends wouldn't have to. I drank the antifreeze,\\nI spat out the teeth, but who's going to catch me when I drop\\nlike a pheasant full of birdshot? Some days I'm the laundry\\nand some days I'm the lint. It's all perspective. Flared lenses\\nsmacking us with red eyes. Body bags with names\\nno one can read. Maybe we'll drive to Big Sur,\\nmaybe we'll bar crawl down Fig, maybe we'll walk out\\ninto the rain and swallow ourselves whole.\\n\\nTRUTH\\n\\nThe only person I ever met\\nwith perfect teeth was Wilbur, and they were perfect\\nbecause they were false, like half the stories he told,\\nwinning the Medal of Honor, playing violin\\nwith the LA Philharmonic, but there were others\\nI believed—like the one about two men tearing his sister\\nlike cardboard while a third held a gun to his head.\\nWe ate barbecue chips and smoked\\nat the bus stop, where men with knives eyed me\\nbut finally shook my hand at Wilbur's nod.\\nWilbur had fists like electric fences\\nbut he brandished them like bouquets.\\nI liked that. I remember his eyes, 8-balls\\nin a mask full of cracks. We talked therapy and women\\nand the way this city has of crushing you\\nlike a cricket under heel. When we said goodbye, I think he knew\\nwe'd both be worse off without backup, without chips and smokes\\nand weekly tutor sessions where we forgot English 101\\nin favor of tall tales, because this is a hateful world,\\npast the smog checks and empty lots,\\nwhere blood creeps beneath footfalls\\nyet somehow always gets mopped up by passersby.\\nMe and Wilbur, we're the bleeders, we're the ones\\nwandering South Central with nothing\\nbut handfuls of gauze, but we're trying\\nto be better. We're trying to clean the mess.\\n\\nTHIS SYMPHONY\\n\\nThe kids are playing games with broken glass.\\nThe poets are marching into the sea. We are\\nhurting each other with fists and feet;\\nstreet people are cutting themselves in public,\\npouring their guts over cardboard signs.\\nWe crave this symphony of wine and sewage.\\nMaybe people think they can dream their way into peace—\\nsome kind of piss-stained Zen on the sidewalks—\\nbut they're wrong. We're hands beating love songs\\ninto drywall. We're rain finding cracks in the roof.\\nWe're black phlegm . . . or steel. Syringes full of sparks.\\nStained glass scattered across the floor.\\nThe kids are kissing us on our eyelids.\\nThe poets are cutting off their hands. Sometimes God\\nis the needle that slips between my ribs, and the needle\\nis a switchblade, and the switchblade is a stick of hot wax\\nwicked into shape by wet lips. The wax is flecked with bone.\\nCHOKE AND SIGH\\n\\nThick smoke has got me weeping on the corner,\\nclutching old love notes and crossing out words\\nuntil it's all nonsense: I gentle sex cold. Now unbearable heal hair.\\nSitting here with Wilbur, feeling my lungs light up and fry,\\nI toss away my filter, lick my lips in the sun. I keep thinking about the night\\nI fell down the courtyard stairs—how the wine between my teeth\\nprobably looked like blood, how the partiers\\njust kept partying. I found some bananas in the kitchen\\nand laid the peels out where people were dancing, but nobody slipped.\\nA couple nights later, I tried to make love to a girl, but I kept laugh-crying\\nso I zipped up her pants and went home. It wasn't fair,\\nand I have yet to call and explain what happened—how I wandered up 30th\\npast chalk-stained fences with my hands tearing\\nat each other like rabid dogs. It's all fucked, this city\\nand these lights and this noise . . . it's all a bunch\\nof pseudo-intellectuals and kids huffing paint.\\nThe freeways are choked with wrecked frames\\nof bent metal and bone, and the drivers just keep driving.\\nOn the bus, I sit and watch a boy braid his sister's hair.\\nHe's got his eyes all screwed up, his lips parsed\\nand tense. The boy looks at me and grins.\\nHis sister says, Don't stop, and our bus rocks along\\nto a backdrop of exhaust, punching holes in the air we all breathe.\\n\\nEMERGENCE\\n\\nThe talking heads on the news had breaking coverage\\nof the lady who'd somehow sealed herself inside a plastic bag,\\nbut they didn't seem too broken up about it; they went on\\nto praise a boy who designs bowties from his wheelchair.\\nThere's no telling what sneaks around\\nour bedrooms while we sleep—I met a guy on the metro\\nwho said he always opens his eyes slowly,\\njust so the creatures can hide. I saw faces\\nin the chapel organ when I was a kid, in all those screaming pipes,\\nreceiving the hymns we offered and hurling them back\\nlike stones. And the irony of being stoned in a church\\nis not lost on me. Yesterday I refilled my prescription\\nin Wal-Mart and people-watched for an hour. I imagined\\nall the little people piling in their minivans, driving home,\\ncooking dinner, having sex, cutting their toenails\\nand calling it a night. Maybe catching the last half hour\\nof the news. Maybe not. I told my father I believed\\nGod was a sadist and he tensed up. He said,\\nI don't believe that, but I recognized the whites of his knuckles,\\nthe way he kept his eyes on the road. The new meds were no good.\\nWhen I saw a severed foot in the recycling chute, I didn't think twice,\\nand then I thought about why I didn't think twice.\\nI dreamed I was being felled like an oak\\nby all the little people with one long saw, and I understood\\nwhy it was happening, so I let it. I dreamed the ants\\nbuilt our houses and left them there for us to find,\\nnot so that we could be happy, but so that we'd have places\\nto slowly kill each other with toenail clippings,\\nand cheap beer, and love.\\n\\nHALLELUJAH\\n\\nI hate you, I said to the cat, but more to myself, and I threw him\\nout of my room hoping he wouldn't land on his feet,\\nbut he did. There were mascara stains on my pillow\\nthat I still don't know how to clean, or how to explain\\nwhen strangers spend the night. I found a razor blade\\non the sidewalk outside the dispensary but I didn't pick it up.\\nInstead I called my friend and left a frantic voicemail\\nabout how the sky was transparent, or something meaningless\\nlike that, and the Valium couldn't save me,\\nthe Lithium only slowed me down, so I tied off\\nmy right lung and that helped a bit. It's hard to talk\\nto strangers without imagining them as corpses,\\nor lovers who will inevitably ask\\nabout the mascara stains on my pillow. My trachea\\nis a guillotine shifting so slowly I forget it's there.\\nSomewhere it is daytime, and somewhere I am happy.\\nSomewhere I'm not hovering over the call button\\nto 911, just to tell them the sky is transparent. \\nMaybe tomorrow I'll wake up to birds chirping.\\nMaybe the cat will have eaten them instead.\\n\\nBLACKBIRD\\n\\nflying crooked on fettered wings\\nlike maybe it just flew out of a blender\\nand then it's gone as our bus lights flicker past.\\nI lick my lips at the chill smack of midnight\\nwhipping in through the window\\nwhile two dudes share a blunt to my right.\\nWe pass a thin man walking twin pitbulls\\noutside a tattoo parlor. I get off at Imperial.\\nOut behind Southwest, Al and Wilbur offer me a smoke\\nand I nod yes to sirens in the east.\\nWe are all lonely. Someone wrote Fred\\nup and down the staircase\\nlike maybe he wanted someone else\\nto say it out loud. I hope Fred's alive somewhere\\nand not slumped in a gutter\\nor chopped up in some backyard.\\nI miss my stop on the bus ride home and I end up\\nin a neighborhood with sharp fences\\nand cardboard boxes piled on all the lawns.\\nIt takes me two hours to get back\\nand by the time I do, my lip's cracked and raw\\nso I stand out on the balcony and let it bleed.\\n\\nPAST LIVES\\n\\nThat's right, I was a gum stain on Sunset, I was the tongue that spat it out. I was a tear in a speaker buzzing like a fuse. Everyone shut up. I was lounging in Big Bear when my friend jumped out of a tree. When all the college kids swarmed the bars, I was an expired condom in a wallet, but I was also the wrapper, and the wallet. Listen: I was a moth making love to a floodlight until the morning smacked me down. I was a bouquet of daffodils tossed off the bridge. I was thinking about how many of my friends are dead, or how I would even know. I was watching videos of people putting their clothes back on after sex. I was the clothes and the skin they concealed. I remember now: I was a television in an empty room, I was a mirror marked with lipstick, I was a squirrel stuck in hot tar.\\n\\nWAITING ROOM\\n\\nAround the time my girlfriend stopped eating\\nmore than 400 calories a day\\nmy roommate downed two dozen Valium\\nand punched a hole in the mirror\\nhanging off her door. The ER is cold\\neven without the air conditioning on,\\nas you walk past burn victims and epileptics,\\nstraining to stare ahead at pastel morale posters.\\nFrom 1-10, how badly does it hurt\\ntoday? My girlfriend came over\\nand said the cleft in her waist\\nwas her favorite thing about herself.\\nI fumbled with her bra and bit\\nmy lips instead of hers.\\nI told her I could count her ribs\\nbut she took it as a compliment.\\nMy roommate came home from inpatient\\nand brought a new friend. Fall came\\nbut the weather didn't change.\\nMy therapist told me I was drinking\\ntoo much. Questionnaires and pamphlets.\\nVitamins and prescriptions. I cut off\\nall my hair and my therapist\\ndidn't notice. You look tired,\\nshe said. My girlfriend brushed her teeth\\ntwelve times a day. My roommate\\nstopped asking me for advice.\\nWinter came and people kept sunbathing.\\nMy therapist said, Are you currently drunk?\\nI logged the pain in a legal pad daily\\nfrom 1-10. I watched the skyline\\nfor a change. A year came and went.\\nMy girlfriend left me. No one died.\\n\\nMURMURATION\\n\\nOne night my friends busted into a church\\nand broke the high windows, the colored panels\\non the walls, and then smashed their bottles\\nand left. I like the thought of their beer-tinged shards\\nmixed in with Peter's left foot, Jesus' scalp, all\\none mess of shattered frenzy—like starlings drenching\\nthe sky in waves. It's called a murmuration,\\nwhen the birds do it. They flock by the thousands,\\none leviathan spawned from many small, scared things.\\nAugust wrote a poem about the army ants' death spiral,\\nwhere they march in a whirlpool until their thin legs\\nbreak from beneath them. We murmurate in airports\\nand at downtown bus stops, brushing shoulders and pretending\\nwe don't notice, or dancing in the steaming bellies\\nof clubs whose names we can't recall. Every cocktail\\nis a murmuration, like the contents of our stomachs,\\nor the signals jolting through our brains. I like to think\\nthat if we had a 60-second video of all of humanity,\\nfrom beginning to end, it would look like a bunch of dancers\\npirouetting in perfect time and not like a spiral of suicidal ants.\\nI like to think we're all moving in the same direction,\\nwith stained glass under our feet and not at our throats.\\n\\nSALTON SEA\\n\\nPast the road's end, past the car hulls and stripped\\ngas stations, past the outhouses leaking graffiti, there\\nis a beach made of bones, dry vertebrae, split\\nribs, jaws and teeth, and past that is an acid sea, the bones float\\nwhen tossed like bread, nothing lives, past the sea\\nis vast nothing, desert like an ice rink, like flesh\\nwhen a bandage is stripped, and past that\\nmountains chew the sky, windmills creak lullabies,\\nand someone must be up there watching the rubble, someone must\\nbe laughing at how sad it all is, they must.\\n\\nDYSPHORIA\\n\\nAfter Ruth Madievsky\\n\\nSomebody's been peeing into my coffee pot. Somebody's been\\ncutting all my weed. On lonesome nights when the pigeons\\noutside my window are the only company I can get,\\nI think someone injects me with morphine while I sleep.\\nI think I'm dying. I think I think too much.\\nSomewhere between LACMA and the pharmacy\\nI lost my girlfriend, and I want to put up\\nreward posters all across town, but I know I won't.\\nSomeone has set me on fire. Someone put a gun\\nto my head and that someone was me. The city\\nhas become a snapshot of an atom bomb,\\nan imprint of chaotic yes. Every flower\\na firework in stasis. Every paint stain a grave.\\nOn Western and Slauson, Wilbur tells me,\\nHere's where my best friend died, nonchalantly\\npointing towards a gutted phone booth, and then\\nhe cracks a joke about teenage prostitutes.\\nSomebody's tapped his phone and he knows it.\\nHe hears the static through the wires.\\nI think death is an apology. I think God\\nwas picked on in grade school. Was it the drugs I take\\nthat drove her away? Am I allowed to ask\\nmy therapist out on a date? I can't wait\\nfor my sadness to turn into anger, my despair\\ninto rage. I still haven't shaken my shadow.\\nOn lonesome nights he flicks needles\\nand slides tacks into my shoes.\\nDECONSTRUCT\\n\\nSomewhere in the world a boy\\nis getting a blowjob and somewhere\\na girl is gritting her teeth. When\\nI see couples pass and imagine\\nthem fucking, I'm sure they'll die\\nalone. It's only in absence\\na thing can exist. It's the outline\\nit leaves behind. It's the space\\nbetween our lips, the sighs\\nwe tack up in the air to prove\\nwe were ever here at all.\\nIn the evening I'll tell myself\\nI'm something as I study skin cells\\nin the mirror, as dandruff falls,\\nand I'll watch over my shoulder\\nfor anything I can stand between.\\n\\nBIRD\\n\\nWe're blowing smoke in kids' faces, dropping\\nbottles off bridges, kissing our fists\\nas we throw them into trash compactors, like gods\\nof our own lives. Microwave dinners and mixed\\ndrinks in our bedrooms—ink exposing our arteries\\nand hidden parts. On my balcony\\na dove has made her nest and she won't move—\\nI think she's scared I'll take her eggs and swallow them\\nbut we have an understanding: I won't hurt her\\nif she won't tell my roommates I smoke in my underwear\\nwhile our neighbors roam drunk in the courtyard\\nevery night. I don't throw cinderblocks or chairs\\nlike they do, not anymore, so I'm glad she chose\\nmy balcony and not one of theirs. I feel no need\\nto scoop her up, twist her neck\\nand scramble her eggs for the girl I left\\nsweating in my bed sheets, because there is no girl,\\nno condom hung like a dress shirt off my chair, no\\nscribbled note or boxers on the floor. So that's\\nwhere we are, watching strangers kiss in the rain, performing\\noral sex on our coffee mugs and leaving them\\nout to dry. It's a careful lonely we drink when the sky\\nis full of propellers and wings, or hollow points\\nmarking God's awful spot in the clouds.\\n\\nEGO DEATH\\n\\nThe hearts of men flutter and fail, they creep out\\nthrough dry throats and sit there smiling on the pavement\\nlike eggs that won't fry. These are strange days in LA—\\ntoo many manhunts and transports, too many kids\\nbusting each other's faces, reenacting gore portraits\\nthey've learned at home, or out on the tracks\\nafter dusk. Lately I've been stranded in angry mobs,\\nholding unpinned grenades that for some reason\\nwon't explode. I've been boxing in halls of mirrors,\\nsmoking spliffs with vagrant zombies who creep around\\nmy neighborhood. The kids don't stand a chance—\\nby six they've learned the art of the laying on of hands\\nand all its intricacies: the graceful arc of a punch,\\nthe orgasm of crunched cartilage, the baptism\\nof drowning in one's own blood. My skin's not thick enough\\nto ward off the needles, or the hollow points dancing\\nup and down my street. You are here, the sign says,\\nplacing me with a red arrow at some intersection\\nin some neighborhood I don't know, but it's wrong,\\nI'm in a 40 on Vermont, I'm in pistols down Slauson,\\nI'm in a book in Doheny Library—the one about Pluto,\\nwhen he was still a planet, when he still mattered.\\n\\nWAIT\\n\\nI'm still waiting for my lungs to collapse\\nand leak smoke, still waiting for these jackals\\nto break free from my jaw and ravage\\nthe steeples and offices, the dumpsters\\nand all who live inside them. I'm still waiting\\nfor my ambulance, for the liquor store attendant\\nto remember my name. Still waiting\\non that loan installment, still waiting\\nfor my girlfriend to say she loves me and mean it.\\nI've only been hit by one bus and been set aflame\\none time, and the metros are still keeping schedule,\\nthe crackheads are still slinging in the lot next door,\\nthe man whose daughter I'm dating is still Googling me\\nand frowning at what he finds. We're all waiting\\non the moon to swallow the earth, because everybody\\nlikes an underdog—Wilbur's still waiting for me\\nto look him up after all these months. I know a woman\\nwho has bullets for teeth. She sleeps in a doorjamb a block away\\nfrom the university, in piles of cans she's collected\\nduring the day. She's still waiting for Jesus, like my parents,\\nor the bishop, or the devil, twiddling his thumbs\\noutside the temple. We're all waiting for each other\\nto give up the ghost. We're all waiting for someone\\nto teach us how to die.\\n\\nGHOSTS\\n\\nAn hour before the party, before one hundred ghosts\\nflood my backyard, I'm on the porch picking\\na scab through a tear in my jeans, a splash\\nof wine dusting my beard. At the grocery store\\nI stumbled into one ghost who showed me\\nthe scratch marks I'd left all down her back\\nthe month before. The rows of frozen pizzas watched me\\nturn and walk away. Ghosts in our pockets, ghosts in our ears,\\nghosts boxing in our crawl spaces. Twenty minutes\\nbefore the party, Michael's cat runs away,\\nand he's stumbling around in his underwear, shaking\\na cup of cat food and calling out, Moxie! Moxie?,\\nin the kind of voice you use to talk to a baby.\\nHe's either going to break a window or cry,\\nI'm not sure which, but I do know this:\\nfive minutes before the party, a girl walks in\\nwith purple hair, saying, I'm on a lot of meds,\\nas if that explains everything, and I say, Me too, and then\\nfor some reason we shake hands. I'm sure she thinks\\nI'm a ghost, as she sips her Pacifico in the back, flirting\\nwith boys by twirling her hair like spaghetti.\\nI expect we'll dig a couple graves tonight,\\nmaybe for strangers, maybe for friends,\\nmaybe for our dead cat, maybe just in case.\\nOBJECTIVE CORRELATIVE\\n\\nAn ice tray, a moth in the shower, a box\\nof dominoes, a Bible soaked in gin, a hundred\\nemails, a dozen eggs, a handful of pine needles,\\na handful of hair, a prom dress, a man\\nwho cries in his sleep, a glass full\\nof milk, a light that never goes out,\\na plane ticket, an airbag, a pouch\\nof tobacco, a pill bottle,\\nsome pliers, a boxcutter, a roach,\\na shadow with no caster, a painter\\nwith no subject, a condom and a neck brace,\\na sandwich full of mushrooms,\\na toilet, a sickle, a tree\\nwith no branches, a letter\\nwith no return address, a moth\\nswimming into the drain,\\nan album full of mouths,\\na sperm and an egg, a row of stitches,\\na switchblade, a glass full of vodka,\\na jury, a verdict, a mountain falling\\nin on itself, a handful of needles,\\na psych ward, a bra, there, at the center,\\nyou can see it if you look close:\\nthe grimace like a tic\\nwhen the wine turns to water,\\nwhen the glass meets the floor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGAUZE\\n\\nI'm glad you've found me here, eating cigarettes in this pile of trash, counting my fingers to make sure I'm still intact—you with your sonata smile and dry ice heart you smother in rolling papers. And I'm glad you understand the nonsense I spout in my sleep, the jerky waltzes I thrust into your chest. You've read the Braille behind my black eyes, the botched Neruda that escapes with every cough, and I'm glad when I run, you know not to chase me. Lily, you're what the Vikings saw the first time the Aurora Borealis knocked them down. You're clean white bone hiding beneath scorched flesh, and the rain, and the gauze. I'm glad you caught me when my tightrope snapped, I'm glad you didn't step aside. Lily, I'm scared. Am I coming through to you? Can you tell me what happens next?\\n\\nLILY SAVES BEES\\n\\nwith soda when she finds them dying on the sidewalk,\\nsprinkling it like holy water on churchgoers' heads. I kill\\nblack widows whenever I find them. I hope she would approve.\\nIt's funny the way people seep into us, like smoke into cotton,\\nor Valium into blood. We pick up accents and gaits,\\ntremors and fears, stories we tell ourselves so many times\\nwe come to believe they're ours. Lily doesn't wear makeup\\nbut you wouldn't believe that if you saw her. She likes\\ndaydreaming about the Apocalypse and how many people\\nare surfing or having sex or falling down stairs\\nat any given moment. I like feeding my brain toxins\\nand wondering where I am, how I came to inhabit this cage,\\nhow many flights of stairs I've tumbled down before\\nhitting solid ground. When Lily strips and comes\\ninto my bed, I hold her like a glass brim-full,\\nand I always spill, and she likes it.\\n\\nFROTHING, ANGRY MEN\\n\\nTime is a bone that healed crooked\\nand has to be re-broken, re-set. Tell me\\nabout the first night you came\\nover: what did you think\\nwhen you caught me chugging wine\\nin the bathroom? Couldn't you see\\nbehind my flush I was nothing?\\nOn the bus after 10pm\\nthere's always someone rolling spliffs,\\nsomeone nursing their child\\nor their wounds. I used to ride\\ndowntown and back on a whim,\\nor over to MacArthur Park\\nwhere they sell fake IDs for cheap.\\nNo one stopped me besides the lunatics\\npassing out flyers for Bible study,\\nlike, Jesus is the way—frothing,\\nangry men with megaphones. You told me\\nI smoked too much and you liked it.\\nI've been meaning to write you\\na list of things I never said, like\\nI want to inhale you through a filter\\nbut tobacco is the next best thing.\\nRemind me of the way you wreathed\\nyourself in light, how you could never\\nscrape me off your teeth\\nor tongue. Teach me the secret\\nof wandering with purpose,\\nof seeing stray dogs\\nand feeling something like hope.\\n\\nEAST\\n\\nI have packed my life into boxes and bags and the last thing to go is my beat-up guitar, sleeping in your arms. Here is the trash bag you stuffed my sweatshirts into, Lily, here is the suitcase I re-packed thirteen times. In five minutes I'll drive east with your bobby pin in my wallet and your breath in my mouth. It's hot out but your hands are shaking. Let them. In six hours I'll lie down in a bed that isn't my own, a bed you'll never see. In twelve I'll be swiping through photos, my phone screen torching my eyes in the dark. In a month I'll be blackout in a dive bar, avoiding strangers' looks, taking a shot every time your accent escapes my lips. In two months, a new bar. The same for three. In every new city, every cold night, I'll remember this moment, the wine stain on your blouse, your fingers on my face, your sobs that serve as soundtrack as I drive towards somewhere else.\\n\\nEXILE / HOMECOMING\\n\\nSitting on an Arizona gravel lawn half-past eleven\\nI thought about where it all came from: one big rock\\nshattered and tossed across a thousand yards.\\nAnd then I wondered if I was sitting on one big rock\\nor a thousand small ones. Or how when I take a drag\\noff my cigarette, I'm really inhaling dozens\\nof burning plants, that were maybe lined in a row, maybe not,\\nbut it all comes together. When does paper stop being a tree,\\nwhen do I stop being the one writing this poem?\\nJackson, come home, Lily said. Jackson, please.\\nThat's what I used to say to myself whenever I stepped\\nout of my body and wouldn't step back in. I read that van Gogh\\nsent his girl a part of his ear. Was that his best attempt\\nat coming home? If he'd sent his hand or his head,\\nwould that have been closer? The gravel is gravel\\nbecause it's no longer a boulder, the tobacco stops\\nbeing a plant once it's rolled, but how many appendages\\ndo I have to lose before I stop being me?\\nJackson, come home. Jackson, we're tired. Jackson,\\nI hate you, I love you, Jackson, I can't tell the difference.\\n\\nPARTY\\n\\nThat's me in the kitchen, falling\\ninto the girl with purple hair,\\nstaring out the window at the mob\\nof bodies clad in sweat.\\nMusic like sirens and clash,\\nliquor soaking coarse beards.\\nI am listening for your voice\\nthrough the white noise\\nbut you're not here—you're toasting\\nthe new year in the Midwest,\\nheld by handsome arms.\\nThrowing hands in dark alleys,\\nscrounging for spent butts, I knew my place,\\nI had my philosophies—the roaches\\nheld up the sidewalks, the flasks\\nfilled our coat sleeves—but now the clocks\\nhave stopped singing,\\nthe Valium's in the toilet.\\nEvery morning I see you in my coffee,\\nbillowing with the steam, and I pitch you\\nacross the lawn. We're breaking up.\\nMy cell phone keeps spewing four-letter words.\\nThese days I scatter condoms like petals\\nacross the bed and gather them back up\\nbefore nightfall. I can't unpack my mind\\nwithout finding dead mice\\nand strangers' thighs. I'm throwing words\\nlike hands, against walls now instead of flesh.\\nThis is sleeptalk apocalypse, burning photos\\nin the sink, flashing strangers looks\\nlike knives, but in an hour I'll be better,\\nI'll strip down and join the mob.\\n\\nBLOODMOON\\n\\nBarefoot on the blacktop, pen in hand, I don't care\\nabout the way the moon is wreathed in red gas\\nor how the clouds seem to avoid it—I'm here watching\\nonly in hopes that you are, too, out on the quad\\nor on your roof, 1800 miles away, or just a phone call,\\nif I could bear twisting the knife any further.\\nBut no, I know you're tasting loneliness too,\\nand hearing each other's disembodied voices\\nmight make sorrow rise from this steady hum\\ninto a scream—it might remind us that we're each\\nwalking and breathing and living without the other.\\nI hate that we can do that. Here in the heavy dark\\nI'm listening to crickets and cicadas call\\nto their mates, God knows how far away. I'm wishing\\nI could call out loud enough for you to hear,\\nthat maybe my voice could ricochet off the moon,\\nthat red mirror of us all, and land at your feet, quiet\\nand self-assured, but no, there's no use pretending,\\nI am not strong enough to do something like that.\\nSMOKE\\n\\nYou've been living in the front of my skull\\nfor weeks, using my brain as a bed\\nor a punching bag, depending on the day.\\nI've been haunting bars up and down Market,\\ntrying to drown you in gin and Guinness,\\nbut failing. I see you in every shop window,\\nin every empty frame, flashing grins meant\\nto console. There's no escaping\\nthe dumb weight of regret—the flood\\nof what ifs that slouch out of my mouth\\nevery night as I stare at the flaking walls.\\nI want to be there, Lily—let me be\\nthe smoke you inhale so I can kiss\\nevery inch of your throat, every crevice\\nin your lungs, so you can watch me billow\\ntowards the smoglight and disperse.\\n\\nABSENCE\\n\\nWhen I think of you in the city\\nsidestepping oil spots and drunk men\\nhurling catcalls I want to burn\\neverything down—all the supermarkets,\\nall the frat houses, all the cafés\\nserving espresso and kale. I see a girl\\ndrinking gasoline and gathering matches\\nto stow in her medicine cabinet.\\nI see streetlights smothering everyone\\nlike box jellyfish scattering their tendrils,\\ntempting those who notice. I'm trying\\nto explain the ghost limb you left me\\nbut I don't know how. Let me try again:\\nwhen I think of you in the city\\nthrowing back a screwdriver on the 81\\nI can't stop rubbing at my eyes\\nuntil I smell the skin burn.\\nYour bouncing, steady gait:\\nit's what takes you away, out of every memory,\\ntowards a place where not everything is a tragedy\\nand I'm not there to reach for your hand.\\nBAREFOOT\\n\\nIn this airplane I'm wondering what it would feel like to fall, to never taste another milkshake, to never again grip gravel between my toes, to never pour myself into the space between your lips the way light goes through clouds, or the way we will, if the pilot's heart or an engine explodes. In my backyard there are shards of glass from nights when the world burst apart, so when you're out gripping gravel, you're also tip-toeing through a minefield. Last week it rained three inches after a year-long drought, and the worms had a field day, dancing on the sidewalk, partying in the driveway, until one got ambitious and started climbing my porch steps. He was slithering up the cement like dew does up a freeway windshield, and I wanted to say, There's nothing for you here, friend, I wanted to carry him back down to safety, but instead I just sat and watched him struggle. And when I went out in the backyard later that evening, I purposely stepped on glass, because I could, and I didn't call to tell you any of this, because I couldn't.\\n\\nYOU CAN'T GO HOME\\n\\nI'm in the muggy strobe light of a Dublin pub\\nrailing snuff off my left hand because two Swiss girls\\ntold me to, chasing it with the only cider I can afford\\nwhen I realize if I ever make it home, the churches\\nwill have tumbled, the palm trees will have burned,\\nand will she remember me after all these months apart?\\nWill she recognize the boy she drank like wine\\nbeneath all these wrinkles and scars? The parks\\nwill be gutted, the skyscrapers demolished, and I'll be ink\\nand booze carried by a new receptacle—one with fountains\\nwhere eyes, nose and mouth belong. You can't go home\\nbecause earthquakes shatter windows, waves crush\\nbeach houses, knives usher friends to morticians,\\nand you watch your own body warp with the jetlag,\\nwith every handshake and pint, so by the time\\nyou return, you're a walking waterfall in a city\\nof paper mache. But will she remember me\\nwhen she brushes my face, her tissue hands dissolving\\nagainst the damp flesh—will she flee\\nwhen my footfalls soak through concrete,\\nwhen I'm a puddle she's learned to avoid?\\n\\nNOVOCAIN\\n\\nI'm back from the dentist and the bottom half of my face\\nis just rubber stapled down—fleshy pulp that moves\\nbut doesn't feel. When I speak I'm a four-year-old\\nand the drive back home was terrifying—not the thought\\nof a crash, but the thought of trying to explain myself\\nin blabber speech to an amused cop, or praying\\nover a dying stranger, making her leave this world\\nto a soundtrack of, I'm so sowwy, over and over.\\nI'm pretty confident I could bite off my lower lip\\nwithout feeling it, but I'm not brave enough to try.\\nI don't know what I'd do with it, anyway: put it in ice water\\nand drive to the ER, or just sit and hold it for a while?\\nThe upside is that, for once, I can feel how my face feels\\nto others: the slant of my jaw, the push of my tongue\\nagainst my own arm. That must be how it felt for you, Lily.\\nI finally know how your fingers cruised through my beard\\nand over my lips. I wanted to call you up and tell you,\\nbut I held off, afraid you wouldn't understand.\\nWhether or not I bite off my lip, at least I have this:\\na pen, a page, your fingers brushing my chin\\nfrom five hundred miles away.\\n\\nATROPHY\\n\\nMore and more I feel like the bits of tire left\\nin skid marks on the freeway where people crashed\\nand maybe died. Or the blood I rub off\\nmy fingertips as I crush this mosquito\\non my thigh. More than anything, I feel like\\na bathroom trash bin full of fingernail clippings,\\nor the clippings themselves. If dust really is\\nmostly skin particles, I wonder how much of you\\nis left in my old room, Lily, on the now empty\\nbookshelves and floors. I know you feel the same:\\nlike no one will ever notice the bits of your lip\\nleft on theirs, or the eyelashes you leave in their suitcases\\nwhen they pack up and go. The ink left on margins\\nafter a pen is tested out. The smoke lodged in hair.\\nThe brain tissue killed with every swallow or puff,\\nand the memories that go along, and the memories\\nthat remain.\\n\\nSTILL LIFE OF LILY\\n\\nAnd there was love in the lip balm, and the feathers,\\nand the waist-length hairs you left draped across my pillow,\\nlike power lines downed by a tree. And I said terrible sad things\\nto you while you were asleep, and I repeated them later on\\nto the bathroom mirror, after you'd already brushed your teeth\\nand left. And there was love in the flasks of Fireball,\\nand in the toilet bowl's warmth right after you'd left it,\\nand there was love in the ants out back,\\ndragging stray pieces of glass away from their hills,\\nso carefully, so tenderly—I took notes on their movements,\\nwishing I could touch you in the same way. And you said\\nyou'd never cried in your life, the morning after you sobbed\\nand left stains all over my mattress, the morning after\\nI said terrible sad things to you, thinking you were asleep.\\nAnd I fell into other women's beds, and I drank\\ntheir perfumes, but despite my best efforts, they all tasted\\nlike you. And I drank myself into a coma. And you smoked\\nenough weed to kill a bull. And I scooped up all the remnants\\nand stray pieces of glass and built this bouquet of words\\nthat will never be enough. And I tried again.\\n\\nAPOSTROPHE\\n\\nI. Do you see what I'm seeing, Lily? The bricks are tumbling from cracked tar beds and the ground is drowning in white. Faint laughs escape through barred windows into the night. Over the rooftops lights flicker from the mountain's ribs—I wonder who is out there, whether they're wondering about me. In my dream we climb the temple and you shove me from the spire. Now I'm sprawled on the blacktop, pushing through sheets of memories like clothes on a line. The crows hold up the evening, neon signs lure moths and men. With my knuckles barked and my cheek pressing concrete I'm remembering the way my lips glowed when last I kissed you. I wish I could put you in that car, tie your hands to the wheel, make you look back as I did, because I did, and the sky didn't rain fire, the earth didn't melt. The sun whispered dirges too faint to make out and I kicked the gas into the floor. There's a cold wind tonight—do you see it? It's coming for us, Lily. It's scattering us like salt.\\n\\nII. You are tearing holes in my pockets, spitting in my beer; now I have to cut you out of every film and frame. It snowed again and the blue fields glisten—leaves and human hair tumble across the sheen. I held out my hand all night like a net but caught nothing. In my dream you tip-toe in from Los Angeles with a shovel and a glass, the glass full of nothing—nothing you can cup in your hands, nothing that collects behind your eyes. Now I am collecting everything, all this ice beneath a salt sheet, warm oil rebuking the road. One time over a couple 40s Wilbur told me I was a black hole, that I consumed everything within reach—he had half a beard and a bloodied eye. A hole cannot exist in a vacuum. It swallows to survive. Now I'm watching the treeline just to see what weapons you'll have chosen when you finally descend. You've caught me in a blackout, here in this miraculous pile of nothing, this pit dug out of a pit.\\n\\nIII. This is something you can't have: in my dream your tongue is still in my cheek, your panties in my hamper. From my basement apartment I catch the cries of bedsprings upstairs. The snow abides, silencing the grass, but the moon's stagger through the steeples proves you're still out there, chewing your nails, licking a joint. Is it cold where you are? Are you alone? Lately I've been crawling the walls at parties, my only friend the slow clap of plates in the sink. Don't make me remember—now that I have no one to repeat my sleeptalk I'm learning to do it myself. I thought I killed you in the rearview mirror but somehow you keep finding your way back. In my dream my father is reeling in a smallmouth bass, jerking the hook deeper into its lip, waist-deep in green flow. He tells me, Just don't hate her when she leaves. Outside the wind falls flat against sheets of cold slag. Lily, can't you see?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOUTSIDE\\n\\nI keep finding myself loitering in the snow, watching strangers clink their glasses through the window's frosted face. In my Midwest apartment I am always scrolling through photos of friends in far places, remembering their tics, their catchphrases and perfumes. The song of skin on skin is always spliced with cold static. My tongue is too scared to speak. I lie in my driveway and watch jets saunter by and wonder if the woman I love is inside, sipping a Coke, adjusting her seat. I want to know why my voicemail won't stop coughing, why my bruises look like smiles. The graveyard is a nightclub, when viewed in the right light. A body is a bullet hole that can't be filled or sealed. Falling is a state of being. I am trying to break the glass.\\n\\nON CELIBACY\\n\\nYes, I am frightened. I watch\\ncouples who don't hold hands\\nand cringe before they kiss.\\nI hear expletives stuck in my walls.\\nI'm picking up condom wrappers\\non the sidewalk when I remember\\nsomeday we'll all be dead. Swans\\nand penguins mate for life. So do\\nmale widow spiders. We try, too.\\n\\nHOTEL\\n\\nThe German girl at the booth to my right\\nwas flashing sexy eyes my way, not seeing the tranquilizers\\nin my smile, and I wanted so badly\\nto take her back to my room\\nand let her fuck me, but instead I choked on my salad\\nand left alone. It's strange fighting insomnia\\non a bed so clearly intended for sex—\\nhoneymoon sex, affair sex, desperate marriage-saving sex—\\nand relying on my ashtray and empty coffee pot\\nto keep me company. On the way home\\nI passed six strip clubs and a sex shop\\nand I didn't know what to say, or whom to say it to,\\nso I didn't say anything at all. Now I'm on the roof\\nwringing my hands and watching a pair of flashlights\\nmeander down the dock, one intrepid, the other nervous,\\nboth burning with the desire to be doused.\\nWhat is this loneliness from strange cocktails\\nand hotel lights on the bay, or pop-ups\\nadvertising sexy singles in your area? These predictable\\nerections and plaster mould ribs—\\nall these frightened people drifting out alone\\nwith the wind and the water, the lime rinds and salt,\\nwhile cover bands croon ballads to crowds\\nimmersed in their meals. In the restaurant\\nthere was a bathtub full of lobsters. Their claws\\nhad been torn off, so when the waiter came to grab them\\nthey couldn't put up a fight.\\nDANDRUFF\\n\\nfalling into my date's drink and she's not noticing,\\ntoo busy seeking eye contact, pushing\\nher hair back with painted nails.\\nShe takes a sip and as scalp tumbles down her throat\\nI feel my bones sing. There's something electric\\nabout disappearing into another person's body,\\nlike the teeth that rake your hand as you thrust it\\ninto snow, or jolting awake after another\\nfifty story fall. At the party girls were dancing\\nlike fireworks as guys poured shots\\nover their heads. I wanted to be\\nthe alcohol, descending gracefully until\\nit settled beneath crazed heels. I wanted to be\\nanyone else, there in the lungs of it,\\nevery footfall a reminder of where I'd been,\\nevery crack in my voice an echo of someone\\nI'd once heard, but the lights came on, signaling\\nit was time to go, gather our belongings,\\nbeg strangers to take us home. The train\\nsobbed in the distance, and a girl said,\\nShut up already, tossing her bottle in that direction,\\nturning before the glass scattered like mice.\\n\\nPANORAMA\\n\\nBring in all the winos, the skid marks and soles, turn\\nall the crosses upside-down, scoop up the college kids and landlords,\\nshuffle them like tarot cards and toss them off the roof,\\nthe night is too young for you to be clutching a toilet bowl\\nand laughing between heaves. Burn your wallet,\\ntake no photos of Solo cups or the pigeons making love\\non the patio, of the clots of hair stuck in the garbage disposal,\\nor even the fingers that will retrieve them.\\nLose a couple lighters, gain a couple friends, live off McDoubles\\nand coffee for a week while tiptoeing down the coast. Fall asleep\\non the road, don't notice as your tires hit the warning grooves\\nand growl, blast Wu-Tang Clan in cow towns\\nand make farmers shuffle their feet. Forget a girl's name\\nas you enter her bedroom and admit it.\\nGather all the scam artists and hippies twisting leaves,\\nusher all the poets into a canyon and wait for the flood.\\nESCAPE PLAN\\n\\nWhenever I see a plane cruising through the sky I jump in\\nand imagine looking downward at my house,\\nwhere I'm going, where I've been, what I'm running from,\\nwho's chasing me. It's usually a girl whose tongue\\nI've accidentally bitten off, and she usually has needles\\nor knives, something sharp—never blunt, never as easy\\nand senseless as a hammer or brick, because\\nthat's not how heartache works. I thought I was getting better\\nat amputations, but there's no such thing as a clean break\\nor a smooth getaway, which is why every attempt at escape\\nvia flight ends in catastrophe: the man sitting next to you\\nhas rabies, you fly into a cloud of ice,\\nyour brain suddenly ingests itself, and still you try,\\nyou practice pillow talk and sweet nothings, you go through\\nall the motions, knowing it will end, knowing someone\\nsomewhere will have you placed on a bed of nails\\nand lay themselves on top of you, delicately,\\nstroking your face as they push and push.\\nPILLS\\n\\nSoft-spoken in the pharmacy as the girl behind the counter plays\\nwith her hair and Johnny stands in his rags outside—\\nthe whole place is generic Lexapro and coffee-stained tile,\\nwhite coats and lighter fluid smiles. I imagine taking the pharmacist home,\\npeeling off her socks with my teeth, tracing the sweat down her spine.\\nHer name is Annabel because I don't know anyone with that name. She likes\\nmimosas and walking through puddles, especially in the evening,\\nwhen lazy shades of night douse the sky. When I get home and take my pills,\\nthe news is on and the top story is another body found in the lake.\\nThe newscaster is pretty but I can't look at her.\\nShe wears too much make-up, she clips her Rs and Gs, she has\\nall the right words but nothing new to say.\\n\\nDOGS\\n\\nNear my father's house there were peacocks. They roamed\\nthe forest and slept in the trees, their wings\\nunclipped, and I used to watch them the way a roach\\nmight watch a moth. There were also dogs.\\nLast night in a dream I remembered how pathetic\\nthe peacocks looked when the dogs\\nhad finally caught them. Feathers in the foliage. Guts\\nin the street. I totaled my car a few years back\\nand for a while I couldn't stop imagining\\nmy body cradled in bent metal had I not\\nworn my seatbelt, had the airbag failed.\\nI read that a fresh corpse has the same\\nnumber of atoms as it did the moment it died,\\nwhich bummed me out, because there's nothing\\nlike a pile of mangled plume to get you thinking\\nabout the way people will stare at you during\\nyour wake, or the glance detectives will share\\nwhen they cut you from the ceiling and go home.\\nBut we're not talking about atoms.\\nThis is about the cradle you make\\nwith your hands when they're drenched\\nin gasoline—clean because nothing can survive\\nthose fumes, trembling because they've forgotten\\nhow to strike a match. These houses made of paper,\\nthese roads slick with tar—is this it for us?\\nIs this where we've been heading all along?\\n\\nDEATH DANCE\\n\\nFor J.S.\\n\\nIt starts with a knife fight in the bedroom, a dive\\ninto the garbage disposal, the low glare\\nof ambulance lights against wet ground.\\nThe night I lost you I was trying to breathe the dirt\\nin my driveway, my body a porcelain sculpture,\\nmy mind a pile of mice. You know the feeling:\\nthe nausea, the fear, the megaphone glued\\nto your ear, amplifying silence. It's 3am\\nand I have half a handle of vodka\\nwith your name on it, but past that\\nI'm at a loss for what to say.\\nI'm always seeing you in puddles,\\nfinding your clothes in my closet and trying them on.\\nBut you had to know what grave\\nwe were stepping into—you saw the signs,\\nthe skid marks, the flames. I'm sorry I handed you\\na switchblade, I'm sorry I handed you your keys, no,\\nI'm sorry I watched you drive through the guardrails\\nwithout telling you the brakes were cut.\\n\\nGHOSTS II\\n\\nIn the Caribbean I learned from a book how to repel ghosts:\\nyou pull your pockets inside-out and for some reason\\nthat keeps them at bay. I tried it last night but they wouldn't stop\\ncoming—ghosts plucking at my beard, ghosts sticking me with pins,\\nbegging to be seen. I wonder if the technique works\\non the Holy Ghost, but I doubt it. He'll be right there\\nwith me, shambling into the chapel on Easter Sunday,\\nfalling into my toilet as my day lurches out.\\nI've noticed lately I keep writing poems about a cruel God,\\nand just now, right as I was jotting this down, the voice\\nthrough my earbuds crooned, The bully always wins.\\nI want to be the bully, I want to suckerpunch kids\\nand decapitate all the stray cats, but instead I find myself\\nfishing for recyclables in my dumpster because Smokey's arthritis\\nis flaring up again. None of us will survive, I know that,\\nwe'll all end up aimless ghosts, except God, who will just sit\\nand watch it pan out. Maybe he's lonely, maybe that's why\\nhe opens sinkholes and sets mountains aflame, because\\ncruelty is just another way of begging to be seen.\\nMy friend eats meat to assert his dominance, like, Ha ha,\\nstupid cow, you thought you were better than me. I break up\\nwith anyone I've dated for longer than a month, maybe\\nwith the same logic. Ghosts of past lovers\\ndrag me out of bed every morning, guiding my hands\\nas I warm up the coffee and munch on toast, and then\\nwhen anybody else enters the kitchen, a roommate or a girl\\nI thought I'd left asleep, the ghosts slink off, giving me the finger,\\nmuttering, I never knew you, I never knew.\\nAND TO DIE\\n\\nOn my friend's Baltimore balcony I was trying to kill\\na cigarette in one hearty drag, and as the wind nudged me\\ntowards the plummet, I thought, this is how\\nI want to die. But not now, not before I've skinned\\nmy kneecaps in twelve more cities and fallen in love\\nhalf that many times. I spent an hour on the wharf\\nwith a homeless man who told me his life story\\nover and over, each time giving his siblings\\ndifferent names, and we took turns sipping\\nshitty coffee as I wondered how many more lives\\nhe'd lived than I had. I'm picturing him now,\\nasleep in a church awning or over a ventilation shaft,\\nshivering in his jacket stuffed with Playboys\\ntoo faded to read. We're always\\nwriting our own elegies. I just wonder\\nwhich of mine will stick. We take turns holding\\neach other together—quick, hold me close,\\nthe staples in my sternum have warped.\\nHelp me find my arms, I lost them\\nback on Aliceanna Street. Once I told a girl\\nshe'd have to fill my lips fast, with a filter\\nor her tongue, or else I'd spill onto the concrete,\\nbut instead of saying I was clever and kissing me\\nshe flashed me a strange look and left\\nto flirt with the bartender. I caught a mosquito\\non my arm and didn't kill it. I watched it\\ndrink its fill and fly away.\\n\\nNOTHING\\n\\nRemove the bullet from my head,\\nslide it neatly back into the barrel\\nwhere it will feel more at home.\\nDo the same with the pills\\nand the ice cubes, mould them\\nback into shape in your palm\\nand pretend they never hit me,\\npretend they never propelled me\\nover fences and through airports,\\nalong terrible sidewalks and spines.\\nLet's walk backwards, let's build\\ncell phones that return all the words\\nthey've stolen from us. Pull me out\\nof this party, away from the Tangueray\\nand Prestige. Set me with my back\\nfacing home and give me a sharp push.\\nI'll make it through the barrel\\nof my doorway, the clip of my covers—\\nbetter yet, somebody call up God\\nand tell him, Ok, you win, people are cruel\\nand destroy whatever they touch, and maybe\\nhe'll pull the atoms apart from inside of us,\\nand first there will be the word, and then.\\nTHE CONSOLIDATION OF LONELINESS\\n\\nOne night in West Virginia, in a cabin in a blizzard\\nin a town of six hundred, I sat in bed alone\\nand listened to my neighbors having sex.\\nIt was desperate and raw, and I couldn't bury my head\\ndeep enough to drown it out. The pillows were cinderblocks\\nand the floor was the keel of a ship\\nrocking underfoot with waves of fuck.\\nI knew it was time for me to leave, time\\nfor me to lace my boots and step outside,\\nto write goodbyes on the windows of every shop\\nwith my tongue, so I did, and when I came to the place\\nwhere the road met the river, I threw rocks\\nand watched them skid across the ice. Dawn crept out\\nlike fingers collecting the sky\\nand I wiped my hands in the snow. I didn't cry,\\nI didn't follow my tracks backwards into the cabin\\nlike a man looking for his keys after a night at the bar.\\nInstead, I found a dark place to sit in the snow\\nand I waited for someone to pass.\\n\\nCOLORBLIND\\n\\nAnd red wine is cunnilingus and cobblestone,\\ntitanium white is public massages,\\nblack coffee is chain smoking in Big Sur,\\nblue rags are knives at the bus stop.\\nValium is eight dollars with a prescription,\\nlike thirty-two gumballs or a movie ticket—\\nanything to drag me out of this house\\nwhere the walls peel like sunburn\\nand the floors are warped and slick. I have blood\\non my shirt from the fight I broke up last night\\nin the middle of a party, all of us feeling like flies\\nstuck in the fridge. Green is my father's canoe\\non the North Fork of the Shenandoah,\\nbrown are my brother's eyes, the same\\nas my mother's, or those of the first girl\\nto break my teeth with her tongue.\\nSometimes I find myself in a stranger's bed\\nwondering what language I'm speaking, how\\nI ended up wearing this skin\\nand learned to believe in a mean God—\\none who lets the rain fall like piss on anthills.\\nGray is my childhood home, or the diagnosis,\\nor the cure. White is a pile of unwashed sheets\\nand the girl still buried in them. I know\\nit's unattractive to break chairs and dance\\nwhen no one wants to move, but something cold\\nkeeps pulling me towards the fray.\\nThe palette is freezing. The technique is sound.\\n\\nGRACE\\n\\nMaybe it takes a mirror. Maybe it takes shower fog\\nto recognize the snarl. There is blur at the bottom\\nof any evening—like last Sunday when I saw a man\\nsmear his date's face with snow. I followed them\\nup Washington, through the park, as gray flakes fell\\nin folds. The man lit a cigarette, his face all wrinkled scorch,\\nand then he stormed away. His date paused, stumbled after him.\\nMaybe it takes a witness. Tonight I watched a cloud\\nof fruit flies descend on my kitchen trash. I raised them a toast\\nas my eyes dried into raisins, my fingernails cracked like glass.\\nMy teeth mumbled prayers against the Iowa chill\\nand I heard yelling in the apartment next door but I didn't knock.\\nWhen everything is finished dying, when the flesh\\nhas turned to soil, it takes the birds still gossiping on the fence posts\\nand the garbage men running their routes. The crunch\\nof loneliness echoes off book covers, prescription bottles, bare chests.\\nIn bed with someone you don't love, wiping out wine stains\\nwith a dirty sock, it's the words you catch slouching out\\ntowards needy ears that rip the raw veins free.\\nMaybe it's an accident. Maybe it takes a detox stint,\\nor tar. Maybe it takes wrestling the memories you wear like cologne\\nand burying them in snow. Maybe it takes a lungful.\\nMaybe it takes it all.\\n\\nSOMETHING BRAVER\\n\\nMy body's holding itself together like origami.\\nThe young deacon's got his face in a book.\\nThe gangbanger's snapping rounds\\nout of a cold clip, and the widower's wincing\\nas he sprays perfume in the kitchen\\nand tries to inhale the cloud.\\nWe're all the same. It's a question of loss—\\nthe wet black night slipping in through our windows\\nand filling our lungs with the names of lovers\\nwe've left crying on the steps, or pets\\nwe've forgotten to feed—the friends we've lost\\non our way to something braver in the dark.\\n\\nA FAILED BALLAD\\n\\nI'm on my back in the grass, watching jets slice the sky\\nlike brushes on canvas, or razors on skin. Someone's singing\\nballads across the park, but I can't make out the words.\\nA cloud the size of Iowa City swallows up the planes\\nand part of me wishes it would fall like a grand piano,\\nknocking us all deep into the earth. There are things I remember\\nand things I forget. I can't remember the last thing you said, Lily,\\nbut it was probably something sweet, some inside joke neither of us\\nwould find funny anymore. I remember the night we met, at a party—\\nI hit the lean hard, and, stumbling home, tried to befriend\\nsome dogs through a fence. They mauled my hand and my sheets\\nare still covered in blood. It won't wash out. It never does.\\nI guess the end of winter means the beginning of something new,\\nbut everything is always happening, anyway, so here we are now,\\nsipping coffee in Founders Park, here we are lying in bed,\\ntalking Kerouac and doing our best Louis Armstrong impressions,\\nand here we are in ten years, trying hard to figure out\\nwhy we always reach through fences we know we shouldn't.\\nLast night I choked on Lithium and watched a special about giraffes—\\ntheir tongues, their necks they swing like clubs\\nwhen they fight. At the end of the show, a mother was defending\\nher child from a pride of lions, and she looked as if she might make it,\\nstomping a wall around the baby, but then she stomped her child\\nin the head. She stood there and then looked downward, slowly,\\nto see the mess she had made. And then she ran, her pitiful skull\\nswinging on its bean pole, her voice silent because giraffes\\nare silent creatures. We are not silent creatures. I wish\\nI could sing ballads, but all I can muster are these lines,\\nthese desperate slashes across paper, like vapor trails behind planes,\\nor the scars we leave on each other's hands every time we embrace\\nand drift apart.\\n\\nTOO LATE AT JAZZ NIGHT\\n\\nWe put the clocks early an hour.\\nI moved to drink under the heater.\\nThe helicopters mumble, muffled\\nover the branches, and I belong only\\nto the keys. But the pianist\\nlay the cover down, let\\nthe bartalk rise. I’m too late.\\nThe bottle of wine I caught\\nmy dog kicking around outside\\nproved there are no new days.\\nThese ashtrays and waning smiles\\nserve as evidence against embrace.\\nNow I’ll watch this couple\\nclad in matching flannel cutoffs,\\nclearly strangers enjoying their\\naccidental pairing, clearly trying\\nto read each other almost as hard\\nas I’m reading them. I wish\\nI could warn them of the ice\\npick every vocal cord sheathes,\\nthe snow a tongue holds back\\nwhen it’s deemed inappropriate\\nto cry. I’d like to say something\\nabout the cavalry of baritones\\nmarching their way outside,\\nthe mezcal-doused raccoon\\ngiven free reign over the trash,\\nbut the jazz is done at La Cuevita.\\nI’ve already said too much.\\n\\n\\n\\nSPIRALS\\n\\nEverything that happens has\\nalready happened. The coffee\\nyou’ve burnt tasted like metal\\nbefore the bottom’s scald,\\nthe man thrown down the\\nstairs has re-ascended after\\nhis last fall.\\n      Back when I\\nhad students who trusted me\\n(the second time, not the\\nfirst), I told them change\\noccurs in spirals—action\\nswoops back into itself,\\nslightly askew.\\n\\t           This time,\\nthe opossum I befriended\\nin my backyard was young\\nand in California, far\\nfrom the mangy mother\\nand the young she hoisted\\non her back in the snowfields\\nof last year.\\n      The doctors\\nin Mercy Hospital elected\\nto thread the catheter through\\nmy jugular vein, but the new\\nones in the Little Company\\nof Mercy wanted to lace it\\nthrough my thigh.\\n\\t\\t    Opossums\\nsecrete a tar-like substance\\nwhen threatened. The woman I\\nsuccessfully left and therefore\\nfailed to leave told me that, but\\nnothing I could find in the literature\\nconfirmed.\\n\\t      My trusting students found\\nme one night, assaulting a jukebox,\\ncursing Denis Johnson for dying\\nbefore we could assault his old\\njukebox together, and they began\\npunching it without asking\\nquestions.\\n\\t    During my second\\nCT scan, the radiologist\\nadvised it’s often helpful for\\nthe patient to play dead. I\\nthink the turn of phrase arrived\\nbecause I’d been bragging\\nabout my pet opossum,\\ndrugged, twirling invisible\\nspaghetti on my finger.\\n\\t\\t\\tSome\\npeople like my father have\\nmemories entirely reliant on\\nassociation. The smell of\\ncigar smoke or hot tar reminds\\nhim of his grandfather, Coke\\nof baby teeth.\\n\\t          You can fall\\nin love with a memory like\\nyou can fall down stairs—\\nlimp and lifeless, or as if\\ndoing a waltz.\\n\\t          Spirals\\ntravel downward, riding\\ngravity, like the blood my\\nfriend watched swarm the\\ndrain the last time he\\nfailed and therefore succeeded\\nat killing himself.\\n\\t\\t   Drunk, I\\ndelivered the same lecture to\\nthe same students, kissed my\\nex-lover in a new part of\\ntown, stroked gnarled fur\\nwith new skin on the same\\nfingers.\\t\\nI’m traveling downward\\nnow, under floodlights long-\\nburned out. Conceptual emptiness\\nwas cool to talk about back\\nbefore I knew my way around\\nthese hospitals. Playing dead\\nis only acting out your exit pose.\\nSomeday, in a place like this, both\\nmy father and I will die. I know\\nall this.\\nLike I know that cutting\\nand tying a string doesn’t really\\nrepair it; it leaves a knot.\\n\\t\\t\\t   Like\\nI know some plaid-clad kid may\\nsomeday read this poem and quote it\\nin a room made roofless by smoke\\nto impress his date. I wish them both\\nscar tissue— reminders of who\\nhurt them most, why\\nthey love them still.\\n\\n\\nAVIARY\\n\\nThese birds, pull these birds out of me,\\nthey’re saying my name in your voice.\\nIn the nude photographs I can bury\\nbut not forget, your kiss is a shotgun\\nfull of salt. I heard a woman on the radio\\nwith bourbon vocal cords croon,\\nThere is nothing in the world more dangerous\\nthan a defeated army headed home, but she was wrong.\\nThe victors haven’t surrendered their arms. When I left,\\nI burned rubber for months. Did you know\\nyou were building an aviary in my chest?\\nThat I’d cough up beaks and bones\\nacross so many state lines?\\nNow I’m licking cocaine off a stranger’s lip\\nand you’re gathering firewood in snow.\\nIn the dark, bodies thrust indistinguishably.\\nSo rip out all the phone lines, love,\\npull these birds like teeth.\\nDo you have a new safe word? Or is it the same?\\nI’m remembering the first time I woke up\\non our broken box frame alone. The cold drumstick\\nI hand-fed the opossum that morning, the way\\nmy bones wept in 4/4 time with hers.\\nDarling, what you have heard is true. I’ve got\\ntwo good arms and a burning barn, inside which\\nI’ve locked peacocks in the rafters.\\nAfter you roosted these things in my ribcage,\\nI left you like palmed wet cement. I told you\\nI’d made up all those constellations, and you\\ncouldn’t believe it, as if no one ever made love\\nto a CO2 leak, as if no one ever spoke clearly\\nand lied.\\n\\n\\nESSAY ON SNOW\\n\\nIt's late and snowy by the lake\\nthat means nothing to anyone\\nbut you and me. Does are likely\\nnestling beneath the brush, drunken\\nwinds wander treelines like fingers\\nthrough hair. Forgive me, I'm nostalging\\nagain. Now I only touch your hair\\nthrough pixels, and it bites like\\nbarbed wire snarling plastic.\\nSomewhere in America it's snowing, and\\nsomewhere I'm still leaning in your\\nbathroom doorway, watching you\\nput on makeup in the nude.\\nMy matchbook's instructions are clear:\\nStrike gently. I don't know what\\nthat means. A fist can never kiss\\na face, just like a face can never\\nhold itself in place against time's\\nquiet onslaught of snow.\\nI left you and filled your void\\nwith fireworks, cocaine, and tar.\\nYou made love to a cornfield\\nand tossed my name like an empty pen.\\nI used to carry you across streams,\\nused to worship your hips\\nas you sauntered through\\norchestras of drunks to find my fist\\nand loosen it. Now the party's over.\\nThe red cups lie on moonlit tables,\\nthe leftovers sit in dark fridges.\\nI don't mean to suggest I still love you—\\nspring strikes every winter down.\\nI'm drunk and I dreamed of\\nkissing your back on our hill.\\nThat’s all. There’s no more water\\nin the lake at Kent Park.\\n\\n\\nGRIEF\\n\\nIt's getting late. The birds are gone,\\nand with them, my friends. I lie\\non a pile of napkins and cans and\\npretend it's potpourri. I've been\\nhitting turns on the 110 too sharp,\\nanxious to feel my car slant\\ninto wreck. Now the night is falling:\\npurple shades of ash. The parrots\\nthat roost outside my window have perched\\nand closed their eyes. I'll burn these receipts\\nin my pocket. I'll lose her every evening\\nwhen she falls asleep uptown. I bought\\nthis bed imagining her body filling its sheets,\\nspread like a crumpled wrapper yawning\\non a table. I have a black eye\\nand dirt under my nails. Gravel in my hair\\nand a lexicon of loss. Los Angeles is\\na bag of worms on a lit stovetop.\\nLos Angeles is a snare drum filled\\nwith dry ice and sealed. Los Angeles is\\na parade of bored dog catchers hosing\\ndown their trucks.\\n\\n\\nTHEY'RE LIGHTING FIREWORKS ON HALLOWEEN\\n\\nShe was an accidental smoke ring, and\\nI was a snarl carving zigzags through space.\\nShe was Braille in a dark room, while\\nI was a kid who caught a firefly and\\nkilled it in a jar. I think it's about time\\nwe all got a little more honest. I write names\\nof faraway friends on my cigarettes\\nwhen I want them to feel my breath.\\nWhen a man threatened to cut my favorite\\ngas station attendant, I did nothing, too busy\\ncontemplating why I had a favorite\\ngas station attendant. Today I pulled\\nmy best friend out of his oxygen mask,\\nlike I do every day. Why he still loves me,\\nI'll never know. Someday when he tries\\nto save me, I'll push him away, saying,\\nChrist almighty, can we get a little leniency\\naround here? ________________\\n\\n\\nNOSTALGIA\\n\\nThese days I'm always looking at photos\\nof myself in far places, waxing weepy\\nover whatever hope I held in that canyon,\\nthat alley, that snowed-in pub. Why\\ndo I do that? How can I remember times\\nI spent months fighting nausea without\\ngratitude for the birds that ushered me away?\\nSometimes I think no one has ever really\\nfigured out how to draw a self-portrait\\nwithout losing a tooth. More often\\nI sit on my balcony and listen to strangers\\nlaughing, wonder what they're harboring\\nin their veins, whom they pray to when they\\ncan't tell noon from night. How many people\\nhave actually read a PBR can's label,\\nthe whole label, the creepy cursive swerving\\naround the neck? Who has any idea why\\nretrospect glosses suffering like cement\\nburies prints? On occasion I hear fireworks\\nout back, from up 57th or 59th,\\nand for the life of me, I can't picture the faces\\nof the woman lighting the fuse, the man\\ninhaling the smoke.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSTRUMMER / OBJECT PERMANENCE\\n\\nSomewhere in Missoula there's a man\\nresetting his nose in a hotel mirror, and\\nsomewhere in Iowa City there's a woman\\nsneaking Benadryl into her pug's bowl.\\nThere's no moon in the sky tonight,\\nbut there is one in a photograph\\nScotch taped to a refrigerator full\\nof probiotics and ground beef. It's hard\\nto dance when there's no music and\\nyou're falling from a balcony. I keep\\ncatching myself longing for the cemetery\\nof hands I left, knowing it's still there,\\nthings don't disappear. Somewhere a man\\nis sipping whiskey while clipping his nails,\\nand out there, somewhere, a woman\\nis wishing her memory weren't a set\\nof inscriptions, but sand, like the man's,\\nlike the flat hum of tinnitus that just\\nreminds you it stole some sound's\\nrightful place.\\n\\n\\nHOMECOMING\\n\\nfelt more like a stage dive\\nat karaoke night onto empty floor\\nthan falling into a pile of arms like\\nI'd hoped. They leveled the old theater\\nand smoke shop, let our old meadow\\ngrow wild.

The dog\\nis killing a plush mallard on the couch.\\nHe's oblivious to the ashes dusting his nape\\nfrom the man's cigarette. The Stones\\ngripe about something from speakers set\\non the dresser, next to the mirror where\\nthe woman likes to watch herself\\nbe fucked. The man brushes his teeth\\nto spare her the taste of smoke. The woman\\ncaresses his beard, his hair. Death's on the air.\\nRabbits outside cry like newborns when\\ncaught by cats. The woman didn't believe\\nthe man when he first told her that, but\\nby now it's become a sort of inside joke. The same\\nas conspicuous shrieks in bed: first,\\nembarrassment, then reckless abandon,\\nthen nostalgia. Now the man is veering\\noff a Los Angeles freeway into a horseshoe\\ncurve. It's been a year. The woman\\nis thinking of how Stanford and the L\\nstill reek of the man's morning scent.\\nThe man is shambling out of a jazz bar\\nwith paper cuts on his eyes. Both lovers\\nbask in the moon's fingernail blade,\\nits unending edge. The woman scours\\nthe counters, throws gloom like clay. The dog\\nis mauling the same duck on the same couch.\\nI'm trying to get at the quiet ache\\nof absence against fingertips, heartfall\\nat the full moon, kindness in retrospect love,\\nhope you'll never see me again.\\n\\n\\nDEPRESSION GOGGLES\\n\\nMy roommates light incense and listen\\nto Miles Davis as I kick dirt outside\\nand gunshots clatter up the street.\\nI've never thanked my shadow or\\napologized to the holes in my socks,\\nnever asked permission before telling\\na dubious truth. Midnight in Highland\\nPark and the novelty of delivering food\\nfor tips in WeHo has worn thin.\\nLast week I brought tacos to\\na pornstar I recognized and laughed\\nat the security guard's limp outside\\nher four-star hotel. I'm afraid\\nthings have gone south. My dog has\\nan anxiety disorder and the woman\\nI love has held her breath for weeks.\\nGod was once a clockmaker.

I got off\\nthe lithium, drove\\nwest to confess:\\nI don't want to be\\nsomeone's daydream.\\nI want to kiss\\nunder floodlights like\\nmoths careening\\nover dust. Photos\\ncradle loneliness\\nlike needles in\\nbubble wrap, safe\\nuntil you jostle\\nthem just so.\\nI don't want to be\\nbetter. I want\\nto be snow.

I said nothing.\\nI'm the son of Siken, Bavitz, and Stanford,\\nand if you're on good terms with all three,\\npull up a chair.

I can't wear my favorite belt\\nbecause my ex-lover used to ask me\\nto tie it around her throat,  I can't dance\\nwith the moon because she's seen me naked\\nand I'm embarrassed to wave hello.\\n\\n\\nDRINKING WITH BERNIE\\n\\nEmily's dog Bernie can't spend an hour alone without crying. Give him a treat and he'll steal it away to his crate. Head upstairs for a piss and you'll find him waiting outside. I get drunk while my roommates work weird hours and I have conversations with Bernie—feed him anecdotes to teach him how to be alone. There's a power in loneliness, I say, but still I come home to shredded toilet paper, laundry torn and strewn. My girlfriend leaves me for the third time and my roommates leave town for a week. Emily pays me $100 to make sure Bernie doesn't die. Bernie tells me they're never coming back, that all we have is each other. I shred letters and upset the neighbors with my sleeptalk. I come home from $7 boilermakers at La Cuevita, anxious to tell Bernie about my day. Out back there's a fresh hole under the fence and someone has to fill it in.\\n\\n\\nOUTSIDE PABLO'S\\n\\nFish bones in my throat as I kiss\\nthis stranger until she pulls away.\\nThree-legged hound ecstatic over\\nabandoned carne asada, full moon\\nmaking me weepy over those\\nI left to face the snow. Waiting\\nfor someone to love you is not\\nso different from brushing your teeth\\nwith a chainsaw.

I understand\\nghosts, their suicide foxtrot when\\nyou thought they'd gone to bed.\\nYou can find me twisting my face\\nin the La Cuevita bathroom any night\\nI'm not doing something more\\nmelodramatic, like making eyes at faucets,\\nSharpie-ing the walls, throwing words\\nat the wind and waiting for some\\nlovelier set of sounds to return.\\n\\n\\nTRIBUTE TO THE DECAY\\n\\nI'm not here to clip your wings, laugh\\nat your hampered escape. I've brought\\nwhiskey and sunburn I won't share.\\nStrange nights under Silver Lake lamps,\\nbotched pool breaks, ramshackle laughs.\\nI have not forgotten the temple your chest\\nbecame for me, heaving into\\nthe tide of my departure, time's\\ncroak as the snow beckoned\\nand took me away. That was love, enough\\nfor two misanthropes afraid of glass elevators\\nand dogs, brimming boxes and closets empty\\nas balloons. I wanted my arms to be the airbag\\nto your jackknife. I wanted my love\\nto be feathers for the falling, but I am only\\na weak man picking his stitches,\\nthe Thirsty Crow, 2am. I'm now\\nmore smoke than substance, trapped beneath\\nthe umbrella of your laugh.

I've got nothing,\\nonly holes in my pockets and crotch, cartilage\\ncrunching when I blow my nose. I drove\\ndeserts and mountains, spun out in Missoula,\\nlost my lighter in Queen Anne, told myself\\nstories of runts becoming alphas,\\nfaces foxtrotting fists, but I've never been a good liar.\\nThat much hasn't changed. I'm thinking\\nabout peeling out, throwing LA into my rearview\\nwithout having touched you again, but my teeth\\nare too ground down, my tongue craves being craved.\\nTowers combtooth the horizon, peacocks roost\\non telephone lines.

Now we dream of IV drips\\nand dry ice mouths, we throw curses\\nat each other and cry. Lighter-singed arm hairs.\\nEchoes in our lungs. I can't touch my nose\\nwithout displacing the cartilage, and you\\ncan't touch the ocean without drowning in\\nsmoke. I'm so afraid we're ruined from the\\ndrugs and strangers' tongues, screening calls\\nfrom friends and therapists, picking scabs to scar.\\nI can't gather you into my arms because you're\\na walking pilot light and I'm the place\\nwhere mouths don't meet.\\n\\n\\nIMMANENT / IMMINENT\\n\\nHeat lightning on the horizon,\\nskeletal oil rigs heaving breath.\\nIncriminating sleep talk forgiven without fuss,\\nfingers clutching fingers over beat-up theater seats.\\nThese are the things I think of when God\\nisn't a Johnny Cash lookalike, black-clad crooner\\nsipping whiskey from a guitar hole, but rather\\nthe taste of a lover's sweat, the color aquamarine.\\nLot of loneliness in the cafe today: a couple\\nbickering over a wayward glance, a sparrow\\nwho can't find the door. I'm thinking of friends\\ncamped out in waiting rooms, dolphins hauled back\\nto sea, but most of all I'm thinking of that darkness,\\nthe nothing of open mouths, freeway tunnels,\\ngaunt memories only summoned\\nby familiar strangers on the street.\\n\\n\\nARS POETICA (rough)\\n\\nI. Listen, we're going to burn down your garage, we're going to pitch quarters into tip jars just to watch them fall, ours is a game of Russian Roulette with a banana gun rigged with M-80s, the coffee can't come fast enough, the blow won't let us down, there is no other way to say this, in bed we're always revving engines fueled by everclear light, we take pride in the scars we've given to drywall, crisscross love notes mirrored on our hands, we don't want to hurt anyone, we just want a story wild enough to remember once the booze is gone, we shamble into the party and shake enough stray flakes to fill five pipes, we're braggadocio housed in body-shaped cages, we're going to keep living until we die.\\n\\nII. The light outside my Missoula motel was mumbling something too soft to hear. Tonight marks my first fist to the face I didn't ask for—the blood is too much to bear. I re-set my nose through the whiskey but botched it bad. My reflection won't meet my eye. There is no other way to say this: I thought I could leave my friends and go it alone, but you take a dog from its pack and it'll find the closest bear trap, trampoline its trigger. The junkies next door tonight sympathized, passed me a flask, but I turned it down. Fell into bed alone, because tonight is just like any other night, moon making faces in the glass. I don't want to hurt anyone, I just want to hurt. How can I return like this, crooked nose, chipped tooth, how can I face the ones I love and laugh for fear of falling to the floor?\\n\\nIII. [We were supposed to be learning how to die]\\n\\n\\nEVERYTHING HURTS (rough)\\n\\nThe sun, the earth, and the animals, a kiss outside\\na hotel, dirt in your eye, dirt on your new scarf,\\ntrumpet buskers leaning on girders, flowers\\nalong the highway, flowers on your desk,\\nwhiskey and Robitussin, croissants and nails,\\neverything under the sun and above, all creatures\\ndead and alive, reunions with friends who don't recognize\\nyou across the street, sweet nothings in pool halls\\nin the houses of your mind, letters and love notes,\\nblisters underheel, everything hurts in its own way,\\neverything sings when you teach it to die.\\n\\n\\nSEATTLE BLUES (rough)\\n\\nSipping half a coffee on Thomas and Boren,\\nmid-day Seattle, tech monkeys for miles, and\\nhave I become a caricature of myself yet?\\nHere without my criminal friends, there's nothing\\ndangerous about a mopey twenty-something\\nwith his life packed in plastic bags half a block\\naway. No honor in wandering when wandering\\nis its own goal, no holy hand guiding when the bit\\nstops being cute. Glass panels stretching skyward\\non all sides, wide arms supplicating, not drowning,\\npraying, no dying here. Some lady just passed me\\nwith a bear dog and I have a feeling even he knows\\nwhere he's supposed to be going, where\\nhe's supposed to have been.\\n\\n\\nMISSOULA\\n\\nThe junkies next door to my motel room\\nare debating the definition of inertia.\\nI hear them under the door over train songs\\nfrom the east. Last night I chased Jaeger\\nwith green tea in Murdo, SD because the concrete\\nworkers told me that's the only way to drink.\\nOne had hair longer than mine and a beard\\nlike an archipelago of red. You can tell the recent miles\\non a car by the carcasses on the hood. Crickets and monarchs,\\nbug parts in Pollock blur. I wish I'd never been born,\\none junkie says next door, and his friends laugh.\\nOne can whistle like a steam engine. Another sings\\nbad, but he can sing. Everywhere I go it rains.\\nMy room has no windows and three deadbolts\\nin the swooping shapes of tusks.\\n\\n\\nCHANNELING WAITS CHANNELING BUKOWSKI\\n\\nHe was a young man traveling west\\nfrom somewhere. No, he was a fist\\nwith a face drawn on flying towards\\na counter. Trivia night at Buster's,\\nliquored grins and a DJ with dice\\nfor eyes. Identical quadruplets\\ntending bar, Minnesota accents\\nrising like dry ice fog. The young man\\nhad his life packed in a dusty car parked\\nup the street, dress shirts, Zippo lighters, all of it\\nstuffed into plastic bags. The DJ was\\ndifferent from the women he'd met—she\\nwas unaffected, had birds ascending\\nfrom her scalp. The bartenders laughed\\ngood, clean laughs, and the piano\\nwould have been drinking had there been one.\\nThe young man rubbed his eyes, cleared\\nhis throat to say something to someone\\nbut nothing came out. He found the patio.\\nTwo cigarettes in, the bar's owner found him,\\nstumbled over like a drunk elephant. Her name\\nwas Kathy. She wore ten rings and spoke\\nof humanity's end. We're humans,\\nshe kept saying, We're humans, we're humans,\\nand as she began to cry, makeup filled\\nher crow's feet, stained the tile table.\\nThe young man leaned back, unsteady,\\ntoo drunk to notice that what Kathy needed\\nwas a hug, or a nod, some affirmation.\\nI don't know what the answer is, she said,\\ngesturing wildly to the guts of her bar.\\nThis poem is for you, Kathy, wiping pint glasses\\nin Mankato, MN, calling cabs every night\\nfor the girls you find praying to the porcelain god.\\nIt's not much, not what I set out to write,\\nbut God help me, it's all I had.\\n\\n\\nAIRPLANE\\n\\nI want you to picture a cigarette lit in an airplane\\nlavatory, and the face its smoke carves\\nin the mirror, arched brow behind wisps\\nof hair. She's crying again and you can't\\nask why. You can't lift your feet, bound by\\nconcrete boots, you can't raise your voice past sigh.\\nPicture a piano in the airplane's belly, all boxed-up,\\npacked in piles of dead birds. No one will ever play\\nyour song on it, no one even cares to ask\\nits name. Scattered through the first class\\nare the parts that make a man—spine, tongue,\\nlungs, it's all there. The parts sit patiently\\nas the blind doctors in economy bite their nails.\\nNow picture the chorus of arrows escorting the plane\\nlike an Air Force envoy, each searching for the wound\\nin which it will fit. I hope you are nothing like me now,\\nlonely in my rubble of days, that you love black clouds\\nonly for what's inside. We once raised toasts\\nto the lights that eked on through, perilous, grayed-out\\nby smog. Now picture our airplane mid-plummet.\\nAre you inside?\\n\\n\\nLAST FULL MOON IN IOWA\\n\\nSirens in the east, moving towards some tragedy, and\\nwho would commit a murder under a moon like this?\\nWho would break anything, a window, a skull, knowing\\nshe was watching from above? I have bronchitis\\nagain—too many smokes and nights not knowing\\nwhat color socks you're wearing, whether\\nyou remember my smell. Hours wheezing, wondering\\nwhat bad jokes I've been mumbling in my sleep.\\nDo dogs howl at the moon or to each other?\\nDid you know how much I love you is why\\nI wash my hands? Someday when I'm better\\nI'll read you a list of the things you became to me:\\nrunway, poltergeist, mourning dove, splint, in hopes\\nyou'll kiss my sternum, crack the same ribs as before.\\n\\n\\nFIRE POEM\\n\\nLast night the house across from mine caught fire.\\nSmoke choked the street, the whole street,\\ngiving us neighbors a screen behind which we could hide\\nour glee. Nothing as exciting as fifteen firefighters\\nand open flame ever occurs in this town,\\nno one weeps like the woman whose albums\\nand books have burned. I had the radiologist thread a tube\\nthrough my jugular to my belly to plug some veins,\\nburn them out. The hole in my neck healed,\\nthe veins did not. I've spent years hanging photos\\nfrom lines and Roman candling them down.\\nMany a night like this, pilfering the cabinets\\nand waiting for my love to drag me back to bed.\\nI have no love. No kindness for my veins\\nor my neighbor, my reflection or yours.\\nThis mess of memories is all I have, nothing without\\nwhat I have lost. After enough botched immolations,\\ncolor fades gray, tomatoes and balloons bow\\nto aluminum and ash. There is no one else\\nhere tonight. That's fine. I never asked them to be.\\nI never gave my heart to the fireplace, never\\ndanced in circles around its smoldered fist.\\n\\n\\nYOU THERE—ME HERE\\n\\nBlack marks flower my walls where fists or palms\\nfound footing, mid-fight or mid-fuck. Tonight\\nI'm watching my reflection weep, because somehow\\nit's crucial that someone play witness to his relapse.\\n. . .\\n\\n\\nESSAY ON POWER DRILLS\\n\\nYou can have Manhattan, leave me Highland Park—pack up\\nand flee like the rest. In this coffee shop\\na young man is explaining his fetish of power drills\\nto his flustered date. Listen: it's not funny, his flush\\nas he looks over his shoulder to make sure\\nI'm not eavesdropping. Who has loved him enough\\nto slide the drill's battery in while maintaining\\na sexy smile, who has in all earnestness traced its trigger\\nlike a clitoris? The moxie to lean over a cup\\nof lukewarm espresso and explain something so\\nfragile, to hold out one's hands to a hive, expecting honey.\\nYou and I once swapped sips of coffee in these same chairs,\\ngiggling, licking grains from each other's teeth.\\nI loved you. God, that past tense.\\nThis burden of nights bathed in sweat, days lying naked\\nunder a ceiling that never fell. One day we'll lock eyes\\nover some city crowd, traipsing 5th or Figueroa,\\nsmile, shake hands, but I don't really believe that.\\nSweet woman, please: bury me, burn me,\\nfeed me ungodly amounts of liquid hate.\\nLeave me my city, only don't tell the others\\nanything you told me first.\\n\\n\\nPRE-OP\\n\\n4pm on the hospital roof and there's a dead fledgling, still warm. I don't know where it could have fallen from but it eyes me as I drag heavy, watch scalps cross the courtyard lawn. Another one on my folding chair back home, same squint, same spindly wings. Birds in my mailbox, birds in my bed. I catch mourning doves and pour them shots but they won't accept, won't tell me why. There's a fear so pungent you can taste it, like saline through an IV drip, sea breeze beating sinus. Morphine throws you through that breeze—they up the dose until you soar. I'm dyeing my beard black with a Sharpie when a cardinal perches on my ashtray, tells me anecdotes of needle slips, floods breaching vein walls. The cardinal talks recurrence and success rates, the price of coffee on every hospital floor. Clouds break, petrichor lifts. If I sound afraid, I am.\\n\\n\\nVEINS / LETTERS / MERCY\\n\\nNo one has ever loved me like the phlebotomist.\\nShe takes me by the elbow, cradles my wrist,\\nslips the needle in deftly and with grace.\\nTells me I make her job a breeze, If\\neveryone had veins like these, God would be\\ntoo kind. All I have to give is blood,\\nsome change for Shane on his curb, mercy\\nfor the June bug I find on my mattress.\\nI have my grandfather's veins—bulgy,\\ndesperate to meet the air. They congregate\\nand conspire. Cut my heart's supply, like bombs\\nlaced into railroad tracks. I have prayed\\nto pills and pilsners, the refuse of expired loves,\\ntheir scrawled letters, voicemails like tired ghosts.\\nDear phlebotomist, I don't believe in your God.\\nI don't believe in your love either.

Holy Shit I Love You (1:55)\\n\\n(Stole lines from Denis Johnson, James Wright, August Luhrs)\\n\\nIn June of 2015 I stuffed everything I owned into plastic bags and left my lover curbside. The sky's frenzy looked like an electric ribcage, my face felt ready to break. I gathered napkins and split ends, bobby pins and razors, anything that had once grazed her skin, and I buried it in a haze of vodka and miles. It was not my intention to make such a spectacle of our separation. I did not become the portrait I promised I would. After months of lonely, I finally fell in with a luminous woman, before I fell apart. I cut my teeth on driveways and departure dates, autophobia incarnate, found myself making faces and yelling at clouds. And if you want to know the truth, none of this matters, I watched myself pull off that curb and have been wandering dreamstates since. Holy shit I love you, holy shit how do I stop. I fell and fell before I checked myself, knocked on that door we both know not to enter, courting the things we want to feel least, and if I know anything, it's that the human heart is a wasp that feeds whether it's fed or not. Hello darkness, my name is Jackson Burgess. I have said what I came here to say. This brand of self-immolation is only cute and funny until I end up breathing dirt, it's only worth doing if it gets me closer to myself, closer to her, closer to closing the storm gates and putting these thoughts to sleep. This is how a memory dies (it doesn't), and I'm not all right boys, Goddamn, tell me what am I supposed to do with all this now?\\n\\n\\nCALL AND RESPONSE\\n\\nWhen I tell my class to write a poem about nothing, I hope someone will turn in a blank page, but instead I get descriptions of empty beds, open mouths, the quiet between birdcall and response. I draw a hole on the blackboard, give my tired spiel about its ontology, the hole's reliance on dirt. Noon arrives. We all go home. My therapist tells me my face looks normal today. I say nothing's wrong. Two colonies of ants wage war over the crack beside my dumpster for three days before the rain sweeps them aside. I dream of my ex-lover on another man's arm, and there's nothing I can give her, so I say nothing. Nothing pushes her away. A pink moon sings over streetlamps and steeples and no one hears her, so she slinks back into the clouds. Diesel runs in rainbows at the largest truck stop in the country, craving drainage, water it can repulse. I tell strangers in bars there's nothing sexy about desperate bravado, and I break bottles to prove my point. They laugh, leave. We all go home. At the end of everything, I'm a vestige making music out of nothing, and I know I look like an exit wound from where you stand, but even silence makes a sort of sound. I worship nothing, gather it into my lungs. My fingers flee my hands. My heart is a photocopied fist. Photocopied laughter.\\n\\n\\nNOTHING GOOD EVER HAPPENS AT THE DEADWOOD TAVERN\\n\\nNot sure why I released the hounds,\\nleft the oven on, swallowed the keys.\\nStill kicking myself sideways over\\nthe pool balls I let clutter my heart,\\nconfused over whom I'm meant to meet\\nhere in this slouching dive bar, whom\\nI'm supposed to kiss, tell lies, ask\\nforgiveness. For the moment I'll continue\\nlocking eyes with strangers who may\\nor may not look like bottle caps, pillows,\\ngraveyards wreathed in steam. Tonight\\nI'll embrace any specter who creeps in\\nthrough my moth holed memory,\\ngiddy burnout that I am, bartalk romantic,\\nI've had enough drinks to recognize\\nmy own presumptions, I'm a blown-out speaker\\nin a sandstorm facing flood.\\n\\n\\nSLEEPING ALONE\\n\\nI guess I ought to be honest, tell you\\nI don't know why we're talking, how\\nthe sky grew knuckles and claws. I get\\nno kick from your anecdotal champagne,\\nyour attempts at humor have me\\ncrumbling like tin foil in my head.\\nNobody's pleased here. Nobody's aiming\\nto please. I have populated this place\\nwith pallbearers, doused myself in streetlamp\\nenough to exhale light. I guess\\nI was hoping we could have a slow dance,\\nmake some pancakes together, I don't know,\\nsiphon some diesel, snap the ribs of\\nmy box frame. Take it from the guy\\nwho's got jackals for teeth: there is\\nan impressive pyre of bad men who have\\nbrought us together. It's getting late, and\\nI'll probably just mess you up somehow anyway.\\n\\nOh hell, here I go again,\\nwhite-knuckling in a coffee shop\\nwith half a croissant triumphant\\nin its wax paper wrap.\\n\\nAnd I don't smile at pretty girls\\nanymore, even when they smile first.\\n\\n\\nFINGER PISTOL\\n\\nSweetheart, there's something\\nI've wanted to tell you.\\nMy dangerous friend has been\\nsending me the same photo of\\na finger pistol every day\\nand I think the joke is\\nwhen I stop receiving them\\nhe's dead. He's a bad\\npunch line, and you're a vagrant\\nI always want to kiss. You don't\\nknow my apartment code\\nor where I hide my key,\\nbut if you needed somewhere warm\\nto sleep, I'd tell you. Lately I've been\\nforgetting street names and blacking in\\non bridges, on rooftops. My friend\\ngot drunk and cut the brakes on his bike\\nbecause a guy in his favorite show did that—\\ntaped it black, ran through reds.\\nWe're both just doing bits.\\nI populated this place with pallbearers\\nand spat in all their mouths,\\ndoused myself in every sin: presumption,\\noblivion, hate. Sometimes I think\\nif I were to be cradled by a fender, that\\nwould be all right. But that scares me, like\\nhigh falls, or when you used to talk about pills,\\nso let's play a game called today\\nwe are not inconsolable. What do we keep\\non our imaginary coffee table?\\nHave we named our house plants? I guess\\nI was hoping we could have a slow dance,\\nyou and I, make some pancakes,\\nstrip and break my box frame. But\\nat the end of every evening, I find this same\\nfinger pistol in my pocket, ask myself if maybe\\nI am your dangerous friend. Sweetheart, are you\\nanything like me? Are you afraid of me now?\\n\\nESSAY ON TORNADOES\\n\\nThere is a dip in the road outside my apartment.\\nI like to sit and watch cars' undersides get gutted\\nbecause if you don't know to slow down,\\nyou always scrape out. It's not the road that does\\nthe damage, though—it's the driver hitting the gas.\\nLeaning into the violence: that's where the hurt\\nfinds form. Drunk drivers survive their crashes\\nbecause their bodies don't fight back. I read\\nabout a man who got sucked into a tornado\\nand lived because a slab of concrete knocked him\\nunconscious straightaway. His body didn't fight,\\njust accepted the blows. My friend Youssef told me\\nproper tornado defense is getting in the tub\\nand laying your mattress overhead.\\nHis ex-girl did that in Tuscaloosa and survived\\nwhen the storm took everything away.\\nShe said it struck with perfect whimsy:\\none kitchen cabinet gutted, the other left untouched,\\nall its bowls and wine glasses pristine. When I first came to\\nthis place I thought there was a beauty in resistance, that\\naccepting the blows signified some weakness,\\nsome lack of resolve. So I looked at photographs,\\ncarried mementos, imagined my ex-lover's face\\nin place of the strangers' I found in my bed.\\nI drank to remember and drank to forget. Found\\nmyself blackout in the alley behind Mercy with her name\\nsliced into my palm. Listen when I tell you\\nsomething I needed to be told: there is nothing beautiful\\nabout surviving eschaton and watching highlight reels\\nto reminisce. God's the saddest guy in the bar because\\nhe remembers what every key on his fob\\nhas locked. Last week I spun out on I-80 mid-storm\\nand waited for the glass to shred my cheek.\\nI don't know why the semis spared me—\\nI'd cranked the wheel left like a dumbass. Evidently\\nI haven't learned anything at all. It is work\\nto carry a head full of maggots and not feed them\\ntable scraps, to think of the one you love\\nloving someone else and not kick the gas pedal\\nstraight into a storm. I am trying my best here to say\\nsomething that is true, but Christ almighty,\\nthese fucking photographs, the gears that gut my heart.\\n\\t\\n\\nSAD POEM\\n\\nDo you feel blame? How are those veins\\nholding up? Do you wish you had better\\ncontrol over the cans lining your bedside?\\nWhat happens to an undiscovered corpse?\\nWhat do you do with the loneliness that creeps\\nwhen you're rolling spliffs in a concert crowd?\\nDoes it get better? Do the tremors fade?\\nDoes she still think of you when someone\\nelse puts his tongue in her mouth? Are you\\nthe man she once thought you were? Are you\\nokay? Are you unbreakable? Are you secure?\\nHow many drunkards does it take to screw\\na gorgeous woman in a memory book?\\nHow many resets does one receive\\nbefore they're dismissed as undesirable?\\nWhat's the point? What's the destination?\\nWhat's the cost of a pack of Newports\\nversus a pack of Reds? Do you still cry\\nover her perfume when it hits you\\nin a stranger's bed? Are you strong?\\nAre you older now, very mature? Why\\ndo these hemorrhaged thoughts still clog\\nyour mindscape? Aren't you over this?\\nAren't you the man you once promised her\\nyou were, the man she loved like rain?\\nThe tendrils of tears or beer trickling\\ndown the drain won't save you any more\\nthan the sunrise will clear away the blood.\\n\\n\\nANNIVERSARY\\n\\nMy neighbor cries the same cry\\nas a dial tone late at night\\nwhen only the rabbits and I\\ncan hear. You and me, we fill these\\nsleeves and sip our tepid Folgers, trusting\\nour goals to keep death chomping its bit.\\nWe read, eat, sleep, drink, repeat.\\nI've written that somewhere before.\\nI don't want you to be afraid, darling,\\nI only want to kiss your earlobe again.\\nThe professor whose eyes look like\\nthe end credits of a movie drinks\\nGuinness and tap water in the same bars\\nas me. He starts every conversation\\nthe same: How's life? Life's the same.\\nWhen the rabbits outside are caught\\nby cats or snares, they always wail\\nthe same. I thought the first one\\nwas an infant, but later I read\\nthat's a common mistake. I hope\\nyou'll forgive me but I still remember\\nthe scent of your scalp in the morning.\\nMost days I wake up alone, have a smoke,\\nwave at my neighbor, crave\\nsome kind of closure, I don't know,\\na cement truck, a toaster, something\\nlike that. And we live like this, with\\nour delusions of proximity, nights\\npulsing with our drugs of choice.\\nI'm still tracing your shadow in chalk\\non the sidewalks of my mind.\\nThis isn't working, you're always leaving\\nand I'm always begging you not to come back.\\n\\nI HEARD THE OTHER ONE BURNED DOWN\\n\\nI'd like to say I found my face\\nbut the best I've got is a pack\\nof smokes and a cute waitress\\nwho won't remember my name.\\nIn this diner my coffee swallows\\nthe ice cubes I drop in, like\\nbaby teeth in snow. Outside\\nthe afternoon is happening and all\\nmy friends are happening with it,\\nchewing their fingernails, sipping\\ntheir tea. I want to hurry home\\nto hands that fit my hands, eyes\\nlaced with something more than pity,\\nless than contempt. But I guess\\nI always knew I'd end up mashing this steak\\nwith this fork at this booth. I can just go ahead\\nand toss out my rearview mirror.\\nI was never going anywhere but here.\\n\\n\\nMIRROR TEST / PHOTOGRAPHS\\n\\nAnd this is the trash can we filled with hydrogen peroxide,\\nthis is the skunk that ruined my jeans. This is the knife\\nTom kept waving around, the nick he took out of\\nmy thumb three days before he lost himself, when we\\nwere still giggly, margarita mad. This is the bobby pin\\nI keep in my wallet though Lily probably doesn't wear\\nbobby pins anymore. This is the way I rub my eyes\\nwhen I'm anxious and this is the look I get from friends\\nwho don't know me well enough to ask what's wrong.\\nThis is the tremor I catch in the diner next to\\nthis old man whose hands somehow shake more\\ngracefully than mine. This is the hotel where Jack\\nlost himself in a flurry of laced coke and conspiracies,\\nthrown playoff games, Pepe Silvia. These are bad\\nfirst dates in rotating dive bars because I can't remember\\nhow to convince strangers to take me to bed.\\nThese are the months flattened by booze\\nwhen I still believed hope was the thing with teeth\\nyou keep locked in the medicine cabinet. These are the days\\nI broke things just to revel in my inability to put them back\\ntogether, like bones, like people, because I lost myself\\nfor a minute there, I threw out my back just for a glance\\nat my reflection, I've got to find me somewhere in this\\nblacktop cacophony, I guess I don't love you anymore.\\n\\n\\nJOE'S PLACE\\n\\nReally, I just want to know\\nif they re-use these coasters,\\nwhat happens to the gum I swallow,\\nwhy I left home just to drink\\nthe same tall boys I have sitting\\nin my fridge. I don't want to see\\nLily swaying ragtime, Lily kissing\\nsome man I may or may not know,\\nand I don't want to see what happens\\nif I start making eyes at the woman\\ngrinding on the popcorn machine.\\nThe bartender knows how to flip\\ncoasters like I used to know how\\nto flip first dates into lovely flings,\\nbut these days all we do is think\\nabout dying. I can rub my eyes\\nuntil I'm all raccoon, flirt shameless\\nwith strangers, lay my tongue against\\nforeign flesh and grimace with thoughts\\nof her sweet graze. Doesn't matter.\\nFive dollar minimum, one more drink,\\none more night ogling memories\\nlike pole-bound dancers, or headlights\\nplaying box cutter to the dark.\\n\\n\\nON NOTHING\\n\\nI'm afraid there's no good way\\nto become dirt. You can choose\\nto carry a pistol or perfume\\nand the bus will still cost you\\ntwo twenty-five, the rain will still\\nfuck up your hair. Stranger,\\nI will be the bad thing\\nthat happens to you, but if\\nnot me, it'll be the man\\nfingering his pocket lint, the dog\\ngnawing its leash. Strange how\\neasily we chew and swallow food\\nwhile in some distant country\\na kid's belly's a balloon.\\nYou can empathize with beggars\\nor the ants you find in the sink.\\nIt's your call. Your fingers itching\\nto slide between cotton and skin—\\nwhose, you're not sure, but there is\\nsomeone out there who's perfect\\nfor you and that someone is probably\\ndead. Nothing is something because\\nwe've given it a name, the space we cut\\nbetween beds and bathrooms doesn't give\\ntwo shits how many words we know, and\\nplease oh please let me come over tonight,\\nI promise I'll sleep on the floor.\\n\\n\\nFUN TIMES\\n\\nI need, I need, I watch my hands struggle\\nto maneuver a spoon. These days\\nI've been locking eyes with strangers,\\nlike maybe that'll bring me back\\ninto my body, but so far it's a bust.\\nI'm always my own audience,\\nin class feigning knowledge or in bed,\\nfingers in hair. I shamble and sneer,\\nall my jokes are cries for help, and hey,\\nwhat are we going to do now that\\neverything in our refrigerators tastes\\nthe same? What's the game plan\\nwith all these bendy straws and bongs?\\nThis is only a phase, an inside joke\\nI'm laughing at, pretending to understand.\\n\\n\\nSAWNEY BEAN\\n\\nI'd like to marry you and find a cave\\nto lure strangers into and eat, just live\\nlike that, terrorizing the countryside, and\\nif that's not love, I don't know what is.\\nI want to wake up and share a cigarette—\\nwon't even feel gross about the spit\\nyou leave on the filter, and I'll master\\nkeeping egg yolks runny the way you like.\\nI know most days I look like I got hit\\nby a bus, raccoon eyes, bleeding gums,\\nbut I clean up pretty good, I promise,\\nand I just wanted you to know\\nI can't remember the taste of your sweat,\\nit's been that long since we saw each other\\nnaked in lamplight, and tell me, darling,\\nhow am I supposed to feel about that?\\n\\n\\nOUTSIDE THE SHORT STOP\\n\\nIt was newly 2017, shirt pulled over his head,\\nsobbing under neon on Sunset and Sutherland.\\nCold sweats and panic, the tolerance of a teen\\nnow two days off the blow. She didn't love him,\\nshe never would, he'd die alone and unfamous,\\nthat's how he said it, alone and unfamous,\\nas if pure bliss were something he'd been robbed of,\\nwhich I guess was true—I'd seen him giddy, dancing\\nnot a week before, in Big Bear, on that lake\\nthat had dried to crust. How our cabin burned\\nagainst the darkening sky, how we laughed\\nalong with the radiator. But this is not a poem\\nabout good times with friends—it's about crying\\nin an alley, knowing that the one you love\\nis fucking someone else five miles away,\\nthe gray ache of looking out of a face\\nthat was never meant to be your face\\nafter days of druggy blur. That evening\\nI held my friend like he was a bag of dust\\ntrying its best to blow away, while cops\\nskulked curbside, the bouncer leered, party people catcalled.\\nBurnouts both, bohemian nobodies, we were quiet\\nnow that the Muse had stepped aside to make room\\nfor Death and her chemical breath, all that winter light\\nspiking off the puddles at our feet.\\nI wanted to write a poem about the moment\\nyou know you're going to die but your friend\\nsaves you at the last second, all dumb grins and hope,\\nbut I've only ended up with an elegy\\nfor the lives we never led. I keep having\\nto remind myself what Charlie said:\\nInstead of sobbing, you write sentences.\\nWe're all doing our best.\\n\\n\\nA CLEAN HEAL\\n\\nI'm sorry boys, I lost my head—must've stumbled over\\none too many turnstiles, barked my knuckles past\\nthe point of clean heal. The last time I said anything true\\nwas in an Albuquerque Super 8 and the only person\\nlistening was getting paid to check me in. And yes,\\nI caught those planes, flushed those drugs, listened for the howl\\nof hunted things we once threw down Sunset, but heard nothing.\\nIncredible, two years of exile and I'm still an asshole.\\nI expected to glean some sagely wisdom\\nfrom the rest stops and ferries, pool halls and drive-throughs,\\nbut here I am, prowling these same streets, wondering\\nwho's going to take me to bed. Fucks me up pretty good,\\nknowing there's no one new to ruin. I have no name\\nfor the sound a cigarette makes when it flares the ends\\nof your hair, but the sound I make when I think of friends\\nand bathtubs is somewhere mid-sigh and sob.\\nI'm still getting used to the jawscape of a city\\nwithout the comfort of handy gauze. I talk and talk\\nabout starting fresh but we all know the jig is up.\\nTime's a hot bullet. We keep our photos in frames.\\nIt's snowing and I'm weepy. I just won't go outside today.\\n\\n\\nSIPPING OLD MILWAUKEE, 4PM\\n\\nI watched that damn trash bag flutter\\nfor half an hour, caught in the dust devil\\noutside my kitchen window, and when it finally\\ngot tangled in the screen, I didn't pull it loose.\\n\\n\\nSHEETS\\n\\nAnd God almighty, there's so much that I don't know:\\nhow to cook a pot roast, when to take a woman's hand.\\nWhat's it's like to watch my heart flicker on a screen,\\nhow to turn down a round of drinks. I don't know love\\nwithout an itinerary, hate without an amp. It's February\\nand the snow never lasts longer than a couple days.\\nI've been meaning to paint more, cough less, evade the Post-Its\\nand dog hair I keep finding in her wake. More Vitamin C, less weed,\\nno more choking on my coffee every time I call a friend\\nand hear they're doing fine. I feel like the one Christmas light\\nthat blew out right before the party. I feel like if I don't\\nget my shit together fast I'll see myself on the news. I hope soon\\nlocking lips with strangers will sound like fun, better than waking up\\nto an axe in my head and chainsmoking cigarettes I can't afford.\\nI wish I could get sick and blame it on someone specific\\nbecause at least then I could aim all this anger somewhere\\nother than the imprint in my sheets, my dryer's steady churn.\\n\\n\\nGETTING IN THE TUB (7x7 7)\\n\\nIt's embarrassing how often I lose\\nagainst gravity, how many times\\nI leap only to return to earth. I've been\\nthinking on the miles between\\nmy fingertips and yours and watching\\nthe horizon for a sign, some\\ngreen flash, some fleet of clouds\\nmarching like wind-up soldiers,\\nbut again and again I end up\\npicking at my stitches, ladling\\nbathwater in foul streams.\\nFirst the skies turned to snow,\\nthen the snow turned to dirty rain,\\nand the miles in my sneakers\\ngrew too heavy to lug, so I wrote\\nyou a dozen letters, only to watch\\nthem drift into the tub, pulp\\nimposed on apologies, your name\\nand mine melding in this bowl\\nof skin and suds. I'm running out\\nof ways to say this:\\nplease don't leave me here alone.\\n\\n\\n5PM, FRIDAY (7x7 6)\\n\\nI can tell by the shake in my hands, you've relapsed and you're laugh-sobbing to a soundtrack of choppers and rain. And yes, I'm still a sucker for stockings and gloves, I still chainsmoke on the peripheries, even without you here, and yes, you've still got a grip on my frontal lobe, you're still stubbornly clutching wasp nests, but I'll be damned if this time I don't watch from afar. In my dream you were dancing on a table, and the table was loaded with orchids, all snug in slim vases, and you wouldn't rest until you'd knocked every flower free. But your bad knee gave out, your plummet took a year, and still I didn't catch you, I bumped the music to drown your crash.\\n\\n\\nSUSBSTANCE (7x7 #5)\\n\\nYou and I, we move among pillars\\nof sage smoke and sky, we carves\\nform out of absence and pretend\\nthe horizon is more gateway\\nand less closed door, in deserts\\nwith sand traps and brush,\\nwe blow kisses to invisible lovers\\nnavigating the clouds, we know\\nshadows hold their own weight,\\nwe understand the sun's crush,\\nso we fumigate our lungs\\nand hide in folds of feral blank.\\n\\n\\nREDS (7x7 #3)\\n\\nI feel like I wouldn't like me now\\nif I crossed my path in an alley\\nor accidentally swiped my drink—\\nif I dug myself out of the cushions\\nlike a quarter or a lost house key,\\nI'd probably grimace and put me back.\\nAnd more than that, I feel like you\\nmust have known you'd cut ties\\nat some point, self-ingest in a pile\\nof pillows and hair, swallow my quarters,\\nchuck my house key into the fountain\\nwe once toasted to in our 4am\\nhysterics—do you remember?\\nWe knocked holes in those walls, crashed\\nin bushes, in dumpster beds, we saw\\nthe red wings of the world and laughed,\\nfists up, Fuck them all, and there\\nwas some peace in the trash fire,\\nsome truth in the take-out and spliffs,\\nand I still smoke Reds because we agreed to,\\nthat way we could bum each other one\\nif the other was in a pinch—do you remember\\nwhen things were simple like that, when we loved\\neach other like some people long to die?\\n\\n\\nESSAY ON CRYING\\n\\nNo more missing metros, no more rolling over\\nand kissing your collarbone, no more champagne rain\\nor strawberries, spit shared in bedrooms\\non the outskirts of parties, no more watching movies\\nwhere the streetlights sing, where the hero\\nalways wins, no more ticking miles and rehearsing\\njokes to come off as fun and clever\\nwhen I get back home, no more leg stubble\\nor sweat sheets, no more skinny dipping in lakes,\\nno more chainsaws or their sawdust snarls, no more poems\\nabout graveyards or hands, no more thinking about\\nyou crying, because to think of you crying\\nfeels like knowing the moon will never bloom\\nover a meadow again, and I've been kicking myself\\nawake at night when the jackals in my mind\\nassemble, I wanted to say something about how\\nyour face was a city too light-laced to be real,\\nall those gleaming windows, breakneck streaming beams,\\nbut no one ever says what they want to,\\nwhen they say I love you, they mean don't leave.\\n\\n\\nSOCIAL CLUB\\n\\nIs he drunk on the moon, or is it\\nthe moon he's been drinking, do sparks\\nstill catch his arm hair, are there\\nfriends in the bottom of my Pabst?\\nIn five years, when I'm sitting\\nacross from a friend in need, I'll\\nremember this moment, these candles,\\nthese empty stools, Waits grinding\\noverhead, and I'll recall some granule\\nof truth, some perfect knowledge\\nof solitude I'm too down and out now\\nto grasp. There's a bottle\\nin a birdcage over the bar and I can't\\nread the label. It's probably better\\nthis way. I dropped my lucky pen\\nin my beer and now it's hardly working.\\nThe symbolism is not lost on me\\nand I'm not too embarrassed to catch it\\nin verse. My few friends in town\\nare shuffling to bluegrass a mile away,\\nbut the snow is a wood grinder, the street\\nis a pit, my mind's a box of knives.\\nThis is what I sound like alive.\\n\\n\\nCEREMONY (7x7 2)\\n\\nSo once again I'm plucking the lint\\nfrom your old jacket, kicking back\\nthe dregs from your flask. I keep\\nexpecting one of these calls\\nto be you, but it's always Telecom,\\nGreenpeace, discount Tupperware.\\nOn the last night I saw you\\nyou were mumbling blackout\\non a La-Z-Boy in a part of town\\nI'd never been, but somehow still\\ndidn't regret leaving you. I regret\\nit now, but since then\\nthe mirrors are all empty, the walls\\nconceal studs, the only solace\\nI find in bottles is watching them\\nsail skyward. I'd like you to know\\neveryone still asks about you, as if\\nI'm the authority, but nowadays\\nI just shrug and demur, stuff\\nmy hand into your sleeve, hoping\\nmaybe it'll come out yours.\\n\\n\\nSUCCESS RATES\\n\\n4am on another Monday\\nand naturally I'm reading\\nabout war crimes, gas masks\\non their grayscale stage, lives\\ndeemed not worth life, knives\\nand lab coats, because the SUV\\nacross the street grew a face\\nduring my last smoke break\\nand looked like it was about\\nto say something frightening.\\nI've been having that waking\\ndream again where roadways\\ndrift slantward and render\\nvanishing points into walls,\\nthe gas pedal welcomes\\nmy weight, so I don't drive at night\\nthese days, I just walk.\\nMe and Jack are talking again,\\nwhich is progress from before\\nwhen I'd assumed his silence\\nwas the suicide note\\nhe'd never let hit paper,\\nbut we only do it now\\nin Radiohead lyrics,\\nblackout drunk, or\\npretending to be.\\nI think the SUV wanted\\nto tell me something statistical\\nregarding hemophilia\\nand success rates in that rasp\\nI catch sometimes when sleeptalk\\nkicks my ass, but tonight\\nI can't handle cold facts\\nany better than my booze—\\nI'm so bent on ego\\nand my delusions of control\\n(Mars Black and Titanium White\\nmake my favorite gray,\\nLithium Carbonate\\nand three dollar cab\\nmake a life worth life) that\\nI can't imagine a world\\nwithout me here breathing\\nits air, toeing its lines,\\nbecause that world\\nwould likely be fine.\\nMaybe tonight the Dog Man\\nwill return, kick off his boots,\\ntalk about circuitry\\nat my bedside\\nlike he did last week\\nin Denver when I awoke\\nto my hotel door ajar,\\nhis fist of a snout, maybe\\nhe'll know how to burn\\nout a nerve ending\\nwithout summoning thoughts\\nof myxomatosis, rabbits\\nin headlights, tonight\\nI want to believe\\nthe Dog Man is going\\nto help me retrieve\\nmy tongue from its tunnel,\\ntogether we'll smoke out\\nthe bats in my attic,\\nMolotov the steeples.\\nNow I know how to burn\\nrubber and not wince,\\nI've learned to render\\nvanishing points into pills,\\nand Jack, if you're listening,\\nI hope I come through\\nloud and clear, this\\ndesperate flat crackle,\\nthese lonely croons,\\nthis is what you get\\nwhen you mess around\\nwith knives in a hot tub\\nand don't finish the job.\\n\\n\\nNO MORE RAIN, NO MORE ROSES (7x7 1)\\n\\nI kick the dog in my dream and wake up\\nto no dog, I carve my initials\\nin an old dead tree, and though the tree\\nis wreathed in leaves, the leaves\\nare really toilet paper, the ice\\nthrows me down the hill\\noutside my apartment, to the bottom\\nof another hill, one with grass\\nthat won't freeze sheet-solid,\\nGoddamn that drip won't go down\\nwith the coffee or smog, my friend says\\nshe's got a bobcat in her bed\\nbut she won't let me near him,\\nshe's going to wait it out in the tub,\\nmy brother says he's figured out\\nhow exactly the world is flat,\\nthere are no hills to get thrown down,\\nmy ex-girlfriend says nothing, nothing\\nat all, I soak my feet in turpentine\\nand leave tracks for no one to follow,\\nI toss a chair through a window, stomp\\non orange plastic bottles, make a scene,\\nthis barista winks as she passes me\\nmy fishbowl mug, I fry my eggs\\nin bacon grease, drive in circles\\naround the bottom of the hill, I know\\nthere's love somehow draped\\nin all this toilet paper, its cursive sprawl,\\nthere's always love, it never\\nreally stops, does it?\\n\\n\\nDENVER\\n\\nEveryone in this city is twisting their face, wanting\\nto be liked, laughing, tripping over the food trucks,\\neveryone is kissing, why is everyone kissing?\\nThey're caught up in the mechanized crazy of snowdrifts\\nand their cursive run-off, scriptures crawling\\nsidewalks. Everyone is sensing the clouds'\\nrelease of the moon, but no one is coming out\\nto watch. I'm grinning at this teenage girl\\nas she dances in the bar aisle for her date, a suit\\nat least three times her age, and she\\ngrins back, she looks like she's having fun, though\\nI can't help but think of Katrina and that company\\nthat paid her hundreds to get dinner with men\\nwho preferred mirrors to windows, Velcro to stitch.\\nTonight I want to take a knee to the blind beggar\\noutside the bar, the one who's singing Sweet Caroline,\\nthe whole thing—he's shaking his cup in time,\\nhe's got something heavy going on in his heart\\nthat I'd give an arm and a leg to hold, just once,\\nand I'll shake my fist at any cool, calm pond, which is run-off,\\nwhich is waste, which is only the end of the evening\\nwhen we all wander back to unfamiliar beds.\\n\\n\\nEVERYTHING BROKEN IS BEAUTIFUL, YOU IDIOTS!\\n\\nI came back to Los Angeles\\nwith a pocket full of photos and a pocket full of glass,\\neyes brimming with ginger ale I'd hoped would mix well\\nwith whatever they were drinking these days,\\nbut I was not prepared for these tabletops\\nand pocketknife lines, the hell they hock up\\nwhen 6am is time for another bump. And that's all\\nto say nothing of the sledgehammers, the crowbars\\nand tall cranes, grave robbers ripping through\\nour old smoke spot, the Denny's where Rockwell\\npuked in the sink, the field where Lily and I\\ndiscovered our monopoly on sunlight—\\nnow the hedges are trimmed below eye height,\\nthe windows overlook pristine cement, and all my friends\\nleft for Echo Park to try and be somebody.\\nI don't want to be somebody. I know I am only as tall\\nand strong as a cornstalk, which is fine by me\\nas long as I end up as part of a row. But I'm still stuck\\non the bitter throat drip and rolled up bills, Youssef's sad look\\nwhen he called us walking clichés, and that stench clinging\\nto my jeans even now, three days after that skunk\\nsent me and Skyler pounding dirt, the fists put through walls,\\nmy achy jaw, our laughter, naked outside Dodger Stadium,\\nthe chemical bath and dog hair, love notes composed in smoke\\nbut forgotten come morning, and who will save us\\nfrom the great gray blank? Who's going to re-set\\nthe bones in our arms, dust us off, put us down\\nin beds that aren't chainlinked or hooked to IVs\\nin the hospital I swore I'd never see again?\\nFor the moment everyone's heart's still going and the sky\\nhasn't become a pair of arms, but I'm too scared\\nof ambulance lights to breathe—we're empty windowpanes,\\ngnarled up knuckle hugs, I've become everything\\nwe once swore against, and all my friends\\njust keep slicing straws, they're going to be somebody\\nbetter than whoever they left back on 29th,\\nthey're going to trade any semblance of stability\\nfor buckets of snow and salt, and here I am,\\nbroke and out of breath, shambling after pleasure zealots\\nwho have long since stopped looking back.\\n\\n\\nSTEADY HANDS IN THE MESA COFFEE RUSH\\n\\nI'm talking dry like a dirt devil, forgotten washcloth crusted up, not a drop for three weeks, which shouldn't be a big deal but is. I've been steady watching the horizon, because here they have a horizon, and the cars inching along like sideways rain. I promised myself this wouldn't be a poem about how she's in Paris without me, that I wouldn't mention my recurring dream of her knocking back a bottle of isopropyl on the steps of Sacre-Coeur, so instead I'll write about this habit I've picked up of imagining everyone naked and then berating myself for imagining them naked. Scratch all that, how about this orange urge to find a bar, some beat-up sports joint, order a couple rounds for the Mormons with their breath mints, the kids with their fake IDs? They serve a solid cup of coffee here, though the top-selling drink is one that's marketed to not taste like coffee. I'm wondering if I look brooding and mysterious in my corner with my very serious Moleskine and scowl, but more likely someone's imagining me naked, chicken legged. When I imagine her naked, I feel like I've done something wrong, and not in a way that feels daring. I'm curious about whether people in France call it French kissing or just kissing. I don't think anyone in this coffee shop cares that I'm feeling like a pillar of salt, that she's suspended in distance, and Jesus, why can't I get this right?\\n\\n\\nASHING INTO A PEPSI CAN IN MY PARENTS' BACKYARD (scrap for parts)\\n\\nAnd oh, if you could see me now, doing crunches in the guest room because it's important I have a six-pack the next time I see you. I'm still playing sounding board to swan songs, still pinching filters the way I used to pinch your ass right before photos. I don't pray much these days, but I think of your split ends and scuffed knees and sometimes that's enough. By your tone over the phone, I know you've got your hands full of envelopes you don't know what to do with. We're still trying each other on in our dreams, wandering cityscapes with thoughts of midnight mimosas in bed, led along by moonstrings too tempered to be cut, and you should have seen the look on your face I imagined when you heard my laugh again, you should've been there to witness all those bridges I burned as effigies to you. We're still lugging armfuls of flowers for our friends who don't care, I'm still cleaning my fingernails with the edge you left me, and you're a bird whose throat is the trigger to my heart, so let the melody loose, darling—let's put our fingers in our eyes and stumble back into each other's breath.\\n\\n\\nBAD NEWS\\n\\nI think I have some idea why\\nyou won't tell me what's wrong\\nbut if I fry you up some eggs\\nor pull your hair the way you like\\nwill you change your mind?\\nWill you hold down my tongue\\nwith your tongue until we both\\ndecide it's not a good day to die?\\nYou're an extra large bucket\\nof Xanax and I'm a nose bleed,\\nI'm that look you give yourself\\nin the mirror when you remember\\nyour hair is just dead cells. I wanted\\nto talk to someone about all this,\\nI should really talk to someone\\nabout all this, but if you're\\na bomb hatch then I'm an atom bomb,\\nall those molten cars and bones.\\n\\n\\nBAD NEWS (7x7 #3)\\n\\nLike that time you snuck up behind me\\nand pinched my ass in the middle of the party. Or\\nthat night in the roofless garage when you called the moon\\ndiazepam and I called you cherry bomb eyes,\\neternal return. I'll write you\\na proper love letter if you'll promise never\\nto talk to me again. I'll superglue my palms\\ntogether so I can't hold anyone else, I swear,\\nbut don't you think there's something\\nuncanny about how well we reflect\\neach other's burns? My mom\\nkeeps having dreams about you and I think that's\\nthe sweetest thing even if my friends\\ncall me a sap. I was just wondering\\nwhat's the best joke you've heard lately? Can you tell\\nwhen I'm calling your name? So here we are—\\nI'll be the crack to your mirror, I'll be the kernel\\nto your teeth, call me cadmium red\\nand I'll Glen Hansard your heart for hours, baby,\\nright up until you tell me to stop.\\n\\n\\nHEIRLOOM\\n\\nFinally it's middle night, the town's asleep\\nand I can watch my breath hit the porch\\nwith no fear of friendly small talk from neighbors\\nintroducing themselves for the umpteenth time.\\nMy father sings and strums throughout the day—\\nlovelorn ballads about winter following spring.\\nHis voice cracks and twangs, he falls deep\\ninto his Valley accent only then, when he thinks\\nI can't hear through the door. I truly am\\nmy father's son, burying old love notes\\nin our overgrown heirloom tomatoes,\\ngiving the dirt her words, the ink that she watched dry.\\nThis late at night, he's due to come down\\nin his underwear, use the bathroom, drink\\nfrom the tap, and in that moment we'll be\\nthe only ones awake in this single-stoplight town.\\nGoodnight Dad. Goodnight son. From my father I got\\nmy fingernails, my jump shot, my rearview mirror.\\nFrom somewhere I'm not sure of I got these lungs\\nfull of confetti and a case of somniloquy\\nonly she could stand. Here in Shenandoah\\nwhere no one but family knows my name,\\nI can watch frost creep over the garden and listen\\nto my father sleep fitfully upstairs, shaking\\nthe house with every stir. If he talks in his sleep\\nI can't hear him through the door.\\nOne of us will have to die first.\\n\\n\\nVAN GOGH\\n\\nI take off my fingertips, send them in packing peanuts,\\nand though you don't want them, you toss them in the freezer\\njust in case I want them back. I pull out my widow's peak,\\ninches of hair by now you've never seen, slap on a stamp,\\nsend it along. In the story I don't tell anyone\\nmy heart is a town—cute little cottages, cathedral and all.\\nYou're the butcher, carving lamb chops. Of course\\nI'm the town drunk. 5am again and the lamps\\nare sputtering to make way for day. Okay, I'm sorry\\nI called you the butcher. What I'm getting at\\nis have you ever seen a gas station\\nthat's gone under, the nozzles draped in yellow tape,\\nthe green plastic screens dustswept? It's no fun,\\nlike me landing in your hometown and calculating the odds\\nof brushing shoulders in the terminal with someone\\nwhose shoulder you once brushed. So I take off my shoulder\\nand Saran wrap it up, tape a tight package to protect\\nthe dust you may recognize when you slice in\\nwith your cleaver, clear some space on the block.\\nI'd rather not mention the nights I spent wailing barside\\nwith friends who were not really friends. The taps\\ndripped what looked like sympathy and I'm ashamed to say\\nI took them at their word. It's been a long year\\nof blood moons and mixology. Towels in the bass drum,\\nhandkerchiefed high hats. I've lost track\\t\\nof how far I've driven straight—if the world is round, I may\\nhave just ripped right through. You can't write through an absence,\\nyou only end up giving form to silhouette. But what's wrong\\nwith being the butcher, anyway? Every town needs one.\\nSay there's been a deluge of road kill and the meat\\nis just going to fester and boil. I had the idea\\nthat any good story needs an ending worthy of the sum\\nof its miseries, but I can't plot my way out of this one,\\ndarling, I can't even put on my fucking shirt. I'm sorry\\nI dragged you back into all this. I'm sorry I made you watch.\\nIf it makes you feel better, I'll be the butcher—\\nseems fitting, all this smoky blood, these ligaments\\nforming lines. I found Jack against our palm tree in the front\\nwith a knife, and I took the knife away so then it was mine.\\nDidn't have the heart to explain that he had it wrong,\\nyou don't need a blade to take off your hands,\\nyou just need a pen and a heart full of villagers\\nstarving, neglecting their herds because they can't\\nget out of bed, watching the last heifer die and boil in the sun\\nbecause the butcher's gone missing, he's lost\\nin the terminal, making eyes at friends\\nwho are not friends, a whole lot of harmonicas,\\nand the thing about the gas station\\nis the pumps are still on, sour green blinks\\nwandering the night, but nobody has the guts\\nto cross the yellow line. I had the idea\\nI could drink my way back into our bedroom,\\nthat same sagging mattress, our clothes scattered like snow,\\nlike fingertips in a freezer left open\\nin case the butcher comes back.\\n\\n\\nTO BUILD A HOME / OUR SONG\\n\\nI like to think of you in the ocean, washing\\nmy name off your tongue, sinking footfirst in sand\\nand pulling free whenever you like. Your hair\\nis tied back loose, only the ends graze blue,\\nall the beachcombers and hippies pause to watch\\nthe glow your shadow leaves wherever you touch.\\nSunlight pours over your skin like words thrown\\nagainst a crowd, but the miracle isn't the beams\\nand their elocution—it's that your body\\nkeeps them at bay. After all of it I thought\\nI had outrun my own misgivings, put some miles\\nbetween my hands and the hell they laid on you\\nand the others, but here I am, plucking beard hairs\\nin my gray cacophony, my fingers batons\\nconducting tunes I'm too glass-eyed to follow,\\nand I'm so small, frightened ghost that I am,\\nI feel there's nowhere left to meander\\nwithout meeting swan songs from rooftops\\nat the homes of old friends. Someday\\nI'll wander westward, find my own\\nocean, a place where the sun will French kiss me\\nno matter what I've done, unconditional tender,\\nanti-panic smooth, Jack will toss me a screwdriver,\\nJamie will grin his I-don't-want-to-die-today grin,\\nTony will have his eyes screwed up over a chessboard,\\nbut you won't be there, will you?\\nYou'll have heard my plane skid and packed your bags\\nwith the essentials, your weed kit and a corkscrew, Marvin Gaye,\\nthumbed a ride to Canada, built a home. I guess\\nthis is all to say I don't care how much you don't\\nlove me, whether you forgive me for peeling out, my hands\\nwill just keep searching for wasp nests and coals anyway,\\nand if I have anything left to tell you it's that\\nuntil this body learns to dissemble itself and leave\\nits pins and needles in places no dogs will find,\\nuntil I am that man you thought I might be,\\nthis will be our song: an echo in a glasshouse\\nfull of motherfucking birds.\\n\\n\\nDROWN\\n\\nThis is the one where you ask, Is that blood?,\\nand she says yes, and you ask, From where?,\\nand she says, People's faces.

Some days you still believe\\neverything you love is only a tall coffee and a tank\\nof gas away, somewhere through that boneyard\\nyou barreled through with fingers on temples, foot\\ngrinding the floor, but mostly you just scowl\\nthrough storm windows at strangers sipping wine.\\nHere's the part where she shows you canine pricks\\nin the meat of her palms, holding them out, teary\\nin the windswept dark. And now everybody's dying,\\nyour friends are dropping like flies, bent backward\\nover altars of orange plastic—\\nit's so cold here in this aquarium, you can't make sense\\nof the carnage in fine print receipts, the blur\\nof concussed fucks, lovelorn exes sending word\\nof blood on the motorways, accidental patricide,\\na splash of tonic with your nostalgia,\\nyou have only eyes and hands, only enough caffeine\\nto get you halfway up the mountain before you roll\\nback on blasted brakes, this is the one we've all\\nbeen waiting for, the one where the lovely people\\nmake it out alive, where you learn to breathe\\nwater and balk at booze, this is the one\\nwhere you stop pretending, where you finally get it right.\\n\\n\\nFIRST FROST IN MONTHS\\n\\nHere at the end of it all, in this bed\\nof a woman I don't know, I am almost ready\\nto admit this was not a mistake,\\nI did not end up licking these lips\\nby some force of frenzied chance—\\nfor the first time I am realizing\\nI may never breathe your coarse hair\\nin a room made roofless by smoke\\nagain. I'm hoping you have weed\\nwhen you need it, a crying bench\\nfor when you need to cry, a set of arms\\ncold enough to hold the fire in your lungs.\\nBut here I am in bed. Someone's palm\\nbrushes my chest and I taste my own tongue,\\nthis bastard slug meandering my head, while\\nsomeone's breath creeps into my ear,\\npunches the drum, kicks a beat.\\nHow do I get back? Lily, I have to find me,\\nI don't know where I went. These sheets\\nwet with rainwater, this grimace\\nholding my face in place against palms\\npressing hard, too hard, but that's right,\\nI walked into this bedroom\\nand closed the door. That was me.\\nThat was our mistake, leaving\\nthe barn door open to our goodbye.\\nI'm watching your smile stretch taut\\nin the memories I usually keep bundled up\\nlike sets of scalpels wrapped in felt,\\nhoping you're smiling in cashmere\\nwith a bottle of cheap cab in bed,\\nthat you finally fixed your janky-ass record player\\nand have someone who will nod off with you\\nto Frank Ocean. All evening I've been watching light\\nsplit shadows in quadrants dancing\\nup and down the walls.

A grieving father is allowed to curse\\nat gas station clerks and smash glass\\nagainst cool brick, pass a bagged bottle back\\nwithout wiping his spittle from the lip,\\nstumble home to his rag-draped bench\\nand weep. A grave is the earth's perverted\\nlaying on of hands. A pack of stolen cigarettes\\nshared beneath smog just might be\\nenough to stave off thoughts of death. At least\\nthat's what I tell myself as Shane sobs,\\ntells me yet again how he got that titanium\\nin his wrist, snarls at a couple sorority girls,\\nextends his claw of a hand, which I take,\\nfeeling his knuckles crumble in my palm,\\nand like that the two of us bear witness\\nto the gloom of stars within smoke,\\npavement warped by heels, ghosts\\nwho weave cursive in the worried space between.\\n\\n\\nPANIC ATTACK IN TWELVE PARTS (now in sep. doc)\\n\\nI. Throat Ghosts\\n\\nOne of these days I'll feel safe in plumage and perfume,\\nI'll nod to the dogs outside my apartment\\nand they'll nod back, break their chains and remain\\nloll-tongued and timid, but until then I'll keep on\\nworshipping antifreeze and tar, imagining my friends\\nrigging up extension cords above blocks of ice. I watch myself\\ngrip keys between my knuckles and wonder why\\nI can't stop humming her name under my breath\\nas I lie next to someone else, someone who loves\\nthe parts of me I've let her see. I'm sorry,\\nthat just slipped out, like my teeth do\\nwhen I flash grins at people I can't stand\\nin order to keep these ghosts in my throat\\nfrom ravaging the dance floor. Nobody move,\\nkeep your hands palm-down, make no mention\\nof the man bent on bringing everyone else down\\ninto his gutter. Keep your eyes and ears bent sidelong\\nin case of wandering tongues, fingers, fists.\\n\\nII. To Her:\\n\\nThe man you loved is kissing someone else,\\nhe cares more about controlling the jukebox\\nthan he does about waking up in his own skin—\\nhe wanders townward through a crinkled haze\\nof smoke and moths, gin and juice, his knuckles barked,\\nhis mind a magpie's nest he'd be ashamed for you\\nto see. The man you loved shows up to the party\\nand stomps circles around the room, making everybody\\nnervous, making himself smile a half-cocked smile\\nbecause he knows he's too smart to really forget\\nthe sweet cadence of your accent, the grit\\nof your hair in his hands, the taste of your teeth\\nin the morning before you've brushed.\\nHe finds company in damp alleys with winos\\nand feral cats, dumpsters and those who live\\ninside them. If he's not burning himself down\\nfor insurance money or spray painting elegies,\\nhe's making eyes at his warped reflection\\nin puddles streaked with oil, chewing a matchbook,\\ncracking his toes. The man you loved knows\\ntoo well the feel of linoleum against kneecap,\\nthe sound a dog makes when it's kicked in the face,\\nthe stench of loneliness in a bed stained with wine,\\nhe's putting on a dress shirt you'll never see, he's mixing a drink\\nwith his thumb, he's waiting for the right moment\\nto slide back into his skin, well aware he won't,\\nhe can't even remember how.\\n\\nIII. To Someone Else:\\n\\nI'll wear that face you like so much. I'll dress\\nin collared shirts and jeans without holes.\\nI'll buy you eggs and flowers, don the cologne\\nyou said made you feel warm that night\\nin the snow bank, press your lips with my lips\\nas hard or soft as you want, in public\\nif that makes you feel daring, in private\\nif it makes you feel safe. I'm having trouble\\nremembering how to swallow, or how\\nI ended up in this hornet's nest,\\nwhat I'm supposed to do with all these voices\\nscissoring my brain—when I say I'll be\\nwho you want me to be, I mean to say\\nI love you, by which I mean don't leave.\\n\\nIV. Blank Face\\n\\nThese days I've been rummaging\\nthrough the shredder of my brain\\nin search of bar receipts, ticket stubs,\\nslices of photos I can splice\\nto reassemble the evenings, tame\\nthe spots of static dark.\\nMy girlfriend wants me to walk around\\nin the nude more often, my brother\\nwants to warn me of horsemen and fire,\\nmy therapist wants me to stop\\nbiting my tongue. Fall slides in\\nand convinces the trees to strip,\\nkicks the homeless in the gut,\\nand all I can do is shake\\norange bottles like maracas and pray\\nto the ordered clatter of pool balls\\ntumbling into welcoming mouths.\\nI sometimes wonder how much longer\\nI can get away with spreading my ribs\\nin the middles of these parties where everyone\\njust wants to dance, not acknowledge\\nmy manic rants like dry ice bombs\\nI lob into crowds, and I'm so damn clever\\nwith my blank face shuffle, someday I'll succeed\\nin estranging you all.\\n\\nV. The Longing\\n\\nSomehow I know she's crying, know she's wearing\\nthat black silk blouse with a V-neck cut, that wristwatch\\nI used to call granny jewelry. Somehow I know\\nshe's unsure whether she wants to burn my letter\\nor swallow it, stamps and all. Somehow I feel\\nher fingers on my cheek, know even now\\nshe knows my mind better than either of us knows.\\n\\nVI. We Should Fight\\n\\nI want to explain those names I was calling out\\nin my sleep and why I lied about them in the morning.\\nI want you to look at me with something\\nother than streaming pity when I'm too drunk\\nto slip my tongue into yours without losing it\\nto your teeth. You walk into a room\\nshimmering and everyone wants to see\\nthe faint hairs dusting your ass,\\nto lick the dirt off your heels. I walk in\\nand slur vague threats aimed at the man\\nin the moon, turn some heads, ruffle my beard.\\nOn my best days I'm a splint\\nand my worst I'm a horny stray.\\nI know I promised I wouldn't make a scene\\nhere in front of all your friends\\nbut somebody's brain is on the wall\\nand no one's acknowledging it. If I'm not\\nwatching a kid puke in an ambulance I'm probably\\npicking my stitches in the Incognito Lounge. If your body\\nis what you call your home then I'm the garbage disposal\\nin your heart. Fuck it, we should fight\\nso someone else's knuckles can get to know my lips,\\nso all your friends can take notes on our footwork,\\nour waltz around the room, and I don't think\\nyou've ever seen the little terrorist who lives\\nin my brain, I'm usually too smart for him, but tonight\\nlet's march right into the trash compactors\\nof each other's arms and rip out handfuls of hair\\njust to see if it'll grow back.\\n\\nVII. Blithe Berserk\\n\\nBury yourself in blackout, bury yourself in unmixed cement, bury your fingers in someone new, bury the evening in snare and tenor sax, bury yourself in bottles of cologne, in gutter dust, in boxcutters, bury yourself in a blanket made of wasps, bury your tongue in the freezer's breeze, your nose in smoke and unwashed hair, bury your friends in the back alleys of your mind, do these things and take pleasure in the doing, in knowing what you don't.\\n\\nVIII. Eraser\\n\\nThey're painting over the graffiti\\nyou scrawled in the bathroom\\nduring that period of your life\\nwhen you thought you could hold\\na woman or a wine glass\\nthe same way. They're talking\\nabout you—nothing pointed,\\nnothing cruel, just cracking jokes\\nabout how you used to shamble in,\\nshrug your coat onto the floor's\\nlacquer, order for two,\\nleave a pint untouched.\\nIn every apartment where you laughed,\\nburned toast, fucked, they are fucking\\nto your old soundtrack of choppers\\nand mourning doves. They're waiting\\nfor you to come back, claim what's yours,\\nthe armpit hairs, the scuff marks\\non soiled wood, the fingerprints\\nyou smeared on damp faces, but no one\\nreally knows you there, not anymore.\\n\\nIX. No Cicadas Out Today\\n\\nThat's odd—no creaky hymns coasting off leaves\\ntowards our naked bodies here in bed.\\nI had a dream I kept showing everyone\\nmy hands and making them cry. I said,\\nSee? See?, unsure of what I wanted them to see\\nor why my palms elicited tears. I keep telling myself things\\nwill get better but the only time I believe it\\nis when my hand is in your hair and my tongue\\nin your cheek. Now I'm making coffee.\\nYou're mumbling in your sleep, maybe curse words\\nor names of old lovers, maybe a plea for me to come\\nback to bed, but I'm too enamored watching steam dance\\nto understand. I have dandruff in my beard\\nand I can't tell if it belongs to me or you. I had a dream\\nmy brother kept marching in and out of the ocean\\nwith bloody holes where he should have had ears.\\nHe wouldn't stop showing me his hands, those hands, slick\\nwith seawater and blood. I could not look away.\\nThis isn't working. Let's go kick dirt in the parking lot\\nbefore the neighbors wake up, make out\\nwhere they can all watch, absently mutter into each other's ear,\\nTake my hand, love, wait until it makes sense.\\n\\nX. Choked in Gloom\\n\\nIn a dark so thick\\nI could scoop it up\\nI stand outside\\nthe party, listening\\nfor the smattered blast\\nof a dropped plate\\nor a tearful slap.\\nBats carve love notes\\nbeneath streetlamps choked\\nin gloom, headlights reach\\nfor their brothers and sisters,\\nfind none. The world\\nwill burst like a melon\\ncinched with rubber bands,\\nangels will descend on beams\\nwith hooks and scythes,\\nthe beer in our stomachs\\nwill stream from our eyes,\\nand everything we always\\nwanted to say but couldn't\\nwill finally find form.\\nI think it's going to rain.\\n\\nXI. Mercy\\n\\nBehind a beard too thick to comb and curtains of stray hair\\nI'm listening for the faint music of clean sheets spreading\\nacross a bed I will never see again. I've been told\\nit's easy to treat everything like a nail when you only\\nhave a hammer, when your hands are bent on breaking\\nto keep things whole. Who told me that? Why can't I\\nscoop myself off this pavement and shamble back\\ninto the space between bra and blouse, hold my face\\nfirmly in place mid-smile? Yes I am a little drunk,\\nand yes I am doing that thing I do where I pace figure-eights\\nalone in my apartment, but I'm only trying to help\\nmyself, forget the others, bury the dark spots of my mind\\nin something other than lithium and cab and where did I go wrong?\\n\\nXII. Holy Shit I Love You\\n\\nAs best as I can remember, this is how it happened: in June of 2015 I stuffed all my dress shirts into plastic bags and left my lover curbside breathing exhaust. The sky's rippled frenzy looked like a tree made out of bones, my face felt ready to break. I gathered napkins and fingernails, bobby pins and razors, anything that had once made love to her skin, and I buried it in a haze of vodka and miles. It was not my intention to make such a spectacle of our separation. I did not become the portrait I promised I would. After all the gums and incisors, queasy perfumes, I finally fell into bed with someone else, someone choking on as many ghosts as me. I cut my teeth on driveways and departure dates, empty pool halls and fists full of air, found myself blackout making faces at a disheveled mess in a stranger's bathroom mirror. And if you want to know the truth, none of this matters, I watched myself pull off that curb and have been wandering dreamstates since. Holy shit I love you, holy shit how do I stop. I was one of two grown men crying over a hooker in Minneapolis at 4am when I checked myself, watched my ghosts seethe like smoke, knocked my knuckles on that door we both know not to enter, courting the things we want to feel least, and if I know anything, it's that the human heart is a wasp that feeds whether it's fed or not. Hello darkness, my name is Jackson Burgess. I have said what I came here to say. This brand of self-immolation is only cute and funny for so long before I find myself breathing dirt, it's only worth doing if it gets me closer to myself, closer to her, closer to closing the window and putting these thoughts to sleep. This is how a memory dies (it doesn't), and I'm not all right, Goddamn my friends, what the fuck has happened to me?\\n\\n\\nDON'T SPEAK\\n\\nAnother day of doing nothing but mumble\\nnonsense in the shower, through the screen door,\\nto the stove. These frantic flashes\\nof memory are enough to make a man weep,\\nbut I don't weep, do you? I don't\\nblame an old building for burning.\\nThey said you'd been trying again to drown,\\nbut don't you know you can't\\ndo that on purpose, you always need\\nsomebody to hold you down.\\n\\n\\nVOICEMAIL TO JACK (1) (now in sep. doc)\\n\\nOut there, somewhere, you are leaning\\non the cane we always joked\\nyou would need—twenty-five\\nand kicking dirt on a radioactive leg.\\nI've tried to keep Ellendale\\nburied in my chest but tonight\\nI'm airing it out. Last night\\nyour doppelganger rolled\\nover the pool table and kicked\\nthe Coors lamp as I threw\\nmy hair around to Kurt Cobain,\\nchoking on my spit.\\nYou were there in the barlight,\\nwatching the drunkards watch us\\nin the manic midnight din.\\nLately I've been thinking:\\nisn't it great how we pretend\\nwe dress the way we do\\nbecause it's cool, that we laugh\\nbecause things are funny? Isn't it sad\\nwatching memories fizzle\\nlike fuses ending at air?\\nThese fucking choppers keep bringing LA\\nall the way here to my Iowa City studio\\nwhere I sit and fume, the choppers' stutterbreath\\nguiding my mind towards black.\\nThey're singing your praises, your muted fear,\\nyour pissed-off chuckle whenever I insisted\\nZooey Deschanel was shit on a uke.\\nThis isn't working. I just tried\\nto recall the shape your face makes\\nmid-grin and failed.\\n\\n\\nVOICEMAIL TO JACK (2)\\n\\nHey Jack, how's that bleach taste, what's your latest Great American Novel, where've you been? You've missed nothing but ketamine cake walks and marches into blenders, hellish evenings washed down with tar. Sometimes when the music gets too loud and I step out for a smoke, I can hear your laugh kicked up off the coast. I hate it. I know you're smashed at the Mandrake or the Painted Lady, making eyes at loud, dangerous women but never making a move. Or worse, holed up in that dank garage, where everything looks like a serrated edge. Tonight I'm chugging coffee in a place much like where you once puked on the couch and got us kicked out, and they're playing your song, I didn't even ask them to, they're playing your song, that's got to mean something.\\n\\n\\nVOICEMAIL TO JACK (3)\\n\\nI wrote it all in a letter\\nsix months after leaving\\nbut I guess it never arrived.\\nI wish you would say something\\nwhen I brand your name\\nacross my wrist, when I spell out\\nyour initials in M-80 dust\\nand snort them. How about\\nwe play a game called hide\\nall the butter knives?\\nHow about you call me up\\nso I can stop writing shit like this?\\nI think you're probably alive\\nbut I doubt that means much to you now\\nthat you've figured out how\\nto rig up that car battery\\nto your chest.\\nYou've got me fucked up\\nthinking about bathtubs\\nand dope, dried blood on my shoe,\\nbut let me just tell you\\nonce and for all, I am fine\\nwith working this out right\\nnow in front of everyone.\\nWhen you are in danger, I am in danger,\\nI catch myself watching your hands\\nat the ends of my wrists, filling jiggers\\nwith tar and mouthwash, Vyvanse\\nand ash, thinking good lord how\\ndo you expect this\\nto save you.\\n\\n\\nVOICEMAIL TO JACK (4)\\n\\nI shoot pool alone at Ugly's, listening to your playlist titled, Getting my shit together, until I realize I'm not even aiming anymore, just slamming the cue ball for its knuckleslap crack. Somehow I know you're not—getting your shit together, that is. The reason I'm here and not home with my cheap beer and familiar walls is that I couldn't stop picturing you getting in the tub. This happy dismissal of the damned must be everyone else's way of life: I've seen them at parties, laughing at their own jokes, calmly explaining spilled drinks, as we shuffled around their shattered lamps, practicing excuses. Fuck, man. It's been a while. I draw a mustache on my hand and pretend it's you. I hear a gunshot in my brain and pretend it's not. You were supposed to be here with me, scowling at college kids and slamming LaCrosse. The way this is coming out, it sounds like an elegy, and the shittiest part is, for all I know, it could be. We used to dance and cry and rage, sneaking boxed wine in through the back, blasting hip-hop off the roof, but now all we do is worry about dying. I don't want to worry about dying. Today I found a photo of us on the internet: we were shirtless on a ping pong table, Sharpied unibrows, pockets full of smokes, I'm sure, but now I'm not sure if I really saw that photo or if I'm making it up for the sake of this poem. All this is to say I'm scared. I don't think there are enough frosty mugs or clean pool breaks to calm me down tonight, thinking of you, your swagger limp, your crazed bong hit laugh, your fingers stroking clean steel in the sink.\\n\\n\\nVOICEMAIL TO JACK (5)\\n\\nI've been sleeping with the windows open, basking\\nin the company of crickets and crows.\\nMy neighbor's air conditioning unit cries\\nfat tears onto mine. They won't stop\\nand I don't know what they're all about.\\nI sleep with a laser, a vibrator,\\nand a boxcutter above my bed—\\neach knows its job, each is meant\\nto get a message across.\\nI've been looking for your reply\\nin the spray paint on sidewalks,\\nin the fine print of deli receipts.\\nEvery time I say my name, I say\\nhalf of yours, and thus I summon you\\nfor a tearful glance before you scowl and bolt.\\nMy neighbors like to yell desperate 3am slurs,\\nsort of like we once did, among the smogstacks\\nand high rise gloom, but I haven't yet told them\\nthat I hear. The faint lights creeping\\noff the mountainside have had me\\nscratching my head for months—\\njust who is out there, whom do they love?\\nI sometimes think a screwdriver\\nwould suit me better than any\\nof these lousy poems, if only\\nto guarantee an answer, to reach you\\nwhere it hurts.\\n\\n\\nVOICEMAIL TO JACK (6)\\n\\nI'm thinking about the night I probably should've killed you\\nwith a punch to the temple before I knew your blood\\nloved the air too much. You were picking on my date,\\nmocking her Birkenstocks, spitting 4loko in bright streams.\\nWe squared off in the alley, two two-faced fuckboys\\nplaying chicken with wet hands we were too scared\\nto throw. A battlefield of blur\\nand our slurred lurch into Lithium and love.\\nWe finally subdued. Tonight\\nI'm hanging with Tom Waits\\nand Earl Sweatshirt on two dueling speakers\\nwith two steins barside, yours untouched.\\nFollow my lead and raise both fists to the moon,\\nthat brimming ashtray, wheeze\\nuntil your breath escapes\\nyour lungs, like blood let loose into gray.\\n\\n\\n\\nCODEINE DREAMS (now in sep. doc)\\n\\nI. All the stations play her voice\\nin eerie stacks of sound.\\nYour father picks up his guitar,\\nruns a lighter across the strings.\\nYou shoot the crow out of the sky\\nand watch it plummet,\\npluck the feathers, weave a bouquet.\\nGray porch lights bleed\\nup and down the street.\\nThe room is aflame\\nas she fixes her hair.\\nThe faucet won't stop leaking.\\nSomeone set the gas station on fire.\\nYou catch the sirens like cans of beer\\ntossed from across the room.\\nShe's chugging cab in the closet\\nas you light a cigarette on the stove.\\nEverybody's watching the moon tonight,\\nits bleary crinkled grin.\\nThe train won't stop sobbing\\nover how few trains run these days.\\nYou wash your hands in gasoline\\nwhile the station drowns in ash.\\nRabbits embrace tire tread.\\nThe river is frozen solid,\\nkids hurl cinder blocks and laugh.\\nYou have thumbtacks in your boots while\\nshe cleans blood from flattened ears.\\nYou stub your toe on the oven.\\nYour father closes the blinds.\\n\\n\\nII.  The rain strikes roofs in wild piles of fists. Worms dance\\nlike they're praising some dark god, maybe you, their staggering Savior,\\nstreetside with knuckles barked and brain drowned in her spit.\\nShe licks her fingers in a bar across town, watching men shoot pool\\nin showers of green sparks. The rain knocks swan songs\\nout of rusted car hulls, hay bales, streetside shacks. You mumble prayers\\nin a language you've only just made up, to your own dark god:\\none of lottery tickets and centerfolds, black eyes and the hands\\nthat laid them. She wanders roadways, tackling lampposts,\\nwalking on water welled up from its grave. Rabbits stack\\nin formation, climb into fourth-story bedrooms. Wasps\\nswarm corpses in joyful squalor. You raise an invisible glass\\nto her absence and she watches you from across the road.\\n\\n\\nIII.  The vending machine\\nspits out a Coors\\nthat's dusty and warm.\\nYou hold it close,\\ncup your sternum.\\nThe toilet graffiti\\nsays, Dead men\\ncan't catcall,\\nnext to a Sharpied\\ndick. You flounder\\nin your shoes\\nfilled with blood\\nwhite like milk.\\nShe finds you there\\non the folding chair\\nchewing your nails,\\nclenching your toes.\\nShe ducks beyond\\nyour sight—lays teeth\\non the armrest\\nlike headstones\\nfor spine-snapped mice.\\nYou notice hours too late.\\nThe moon hangs low,\\na rib on a string,\\nsinging dirges\\nto crows and doves.\\nShe swallows chainsmoke\\nto cull the dark.\\nExhaust escapes\\nevery thing living\\nor on wheels. You hear\\nher singing soft\\nfrom somewhere far.\\nRabbits pick out\\ntheir preferred graves.\\n\\n\\nIV. You alone are dancing over the old stone bridge // The cars carving scars through thick air aren't stopping to ask where you learned these manic hymns // The night sky is leaning towards you like a great cruel bandit sizing up your pockets, pockets full of fur and beady eyes // All across the city bedrooms flicker and drown in dark as couples lie side by side passing joints or turning towards opposite walls // She's scrolling stations on a radio spouting fire // The crows have no use for you and your haphazard odes to tombstones and trombones // Pint-sized pill bottles rest gutterside in dull neon light // She sees your visage in a double glass of cab // Twenty tone-deaf crooners stand in file to salute the moon // Aimless ambulances blast lullabies for her, always her // She's marching into the river // You find a flask in your pocket // It's full of dust\\n\\n\\nV.  Thick strands of night stitch the outline\\nof her outstretched arms through the storm's assault.\\nMen emerge from dive bars with their faces cracked\\nlike bear traps, their fingers bloody, their tongues\\nlagging sidelong into gloom. Now you know\\nthe ache of hammer against sternum, bottle\\nagainst brain. She braves the rain and sleet\\nwearing half a bottle of your cologne and ears\\nshe's shorn from lovers whose names you\\nwill never know. Your father presses his tongue through\\nthe gap in his front teeth, kicks through the screen door,\\ncries. Rabbits tear their teeth on stone gardens,\\nplant them in the soil, and wait. Crows bathe in bleach.\\nYou stumble downtown, through flocks of faceless kids,\\neach waving a flask and a flashlight, each sobbing\\nand laughing at once. Candlelight vigils light up\\non every rooftop. Bricks melt and their burdens meet the ground.\\nI am trying to tell you the end of the dream\\nis always exactly what you expected it to be:\\ntwo lovers crossing paths in an alley,\\ntwo switchblades drawn in sloppy haste,\\ntwo moons meeting in a black sky\\nand making music out of silence.\\n\\n\\nSUNDAY\\n\\nThe crows own the evening\\nbut I have a pocket full of limes\\nand a lover home in bed.\\nAll across the ped mall\\nhorny students trip on cracks\\nand bags packed with coupons,\\nleft by men who sleep sitting up.\\nMy friend gripped my shoulder\\nlast night on the corner, mid-anecdote,\\na look of perfect earnestness flowering\\nhis face. He said, Have you ever smoked\\ncrystal meth?, and his embarrassment \\nwhen I demurred haunts me still.\\nTonight I have nothing better to do\\nthan eavesdrop on dry fountains\\nand the crinkled mutter of choppers\\nsocializing overhead. When the air\\ntastes like pennies and the sidewalk\\ngreets my face, I'll think of my friend,\\ntwist my grimace into his.\\n\\n\\n\\nJEALOUSY OF GHOSTS—line about bringing your ghosts to bed?\\n\\nWhen I read the poems she wrote about him,\\nhalf-naked in my driveway, my mind a flurry\\nof dandruff and ash, I push thoughts of tongues\\nmeeting and legs spreading in foreign places\\nout with the smoke towards dusk.\\nDirty light projections of his fingers tracing lines\\nin the same cursive I twirl now on her back,\\nevery night when her body becomes a diary\\nI am too scared to hold for fear of dropping.\\nLoving someone means meeting them\\nand all their ghosts in an alley and leaving\\nwith knuckles and nose unbloodied,\\nand they always return, as ghosts do, when you least\\nneed reminders—blackout in the far booth,\\nflying to a city where she once lived—\\nbut with each passing showdown you remember,\\nno, she is not stepping out to call her secret lover,\\nyes, you must believe she's picturing you when she comes,\\nof course, you too have ghosts that nudge her\\nin her sleep. ENDING?\\n\\n\\nSHEETS\\n\\nHere in this droning 4am blur\\nyour lover watches your hands shake\\nover sheets marred by wine—\\nthe party was pleasantly disastrous.\\nFriends wreathed in streaming pity\\nushered you through halls and stairwells\\ndescending towards boozy oblivion. Your lover\\ncaught you by your little finger, whispered\\nsomething in your ear, maybe your name,\\nmaybe hers, as if you needed a reminder.\\nYou feel dangerous in bed when you place\\nyour palm on her breast and squeeze. You feel\\nthe gray ache of looking out of a face\\nthat was not meant to be your face, eyes\\nspliced with so many bleary daggers\\nhurled by others who once lay in these sheets\\nand saw you for what you were.\\n\\n\\nRACCOON\\n\\nI heard it before I saw it—\\nmuffled moans from the oak\\noverhead, his ringtail droopy, his face hidden\\nbeneath taut paws. When an animal is dying\\nit often wants to do it alone, much like\\na man might sob in the garden out of sight\\nI watched the raccoon, heard him whimper,\\nwiped the snot from my mustache,\\nclosed the screen door behind me.\\n\\n\\nBROOKLYN NOISE\\n\\nThis cheap blue lonely is wafting\\nout of kicked-in speakers\\nover everyone's head.

And it's true, I was\\nonly kicking dirt clods looking for wasps, the same\\nway I stir up homophobes at the bar by flipping\\nmy hair around. I think I feed my monkey mind\\nmore than my mouth, laying out\\nmousetraps at parties, spiking the punch, lounging\\non the couch, watching ceiling fans twirl.\\nDogfights and cockfights, all manner of mayhem,\\ntime and time again I find myself wooing possums,\\nslicking up my cheeks with Vaseline.\\n\\n\\nCROON (in Atrophy)\\n\\nThere are no explosions here, no friends\\nchecking into psych wards, no cocaine\\non fingertips or lodged in ATMs—\\nhere it is calm birdsong and chamomile\\nby the fire, but Goddamn it I miss you\\nand your conspiracy theories twelve shots deep,\\nthe hymns we crooned over the shattered LA sky\\nas our eyes filled with tears over spilled mixers\\nor silly texts from girls. We were constantly\\non the brink of something unruly, a freezer\\nfull of acid candy, an empty topless bar,\\nnothing made sense on our perpetual trip drifting\\nthrough screwdriver riverbeds, and that was why\\neverything was fine. These days I can't buy\\na pack of smokes without beating it\\nagainst my palm, the way you used to on Fig,\\nup those blurry alleys, in those bedrooms\\nwe will never see again.

Summer stumbles in and kicks me\\nin the teeth, peels me off the concrete, rolls\\nher eyes and throws me through the screen door.\\nForgive me, Jackson, I am trying my best—\\nI am weak and therefore bitter, seduced\\nby sorrow and her perfume.\\nI won't hate you if you promise\\nthe same, there from your crumbling ivory tower\\nchoked with TP and fire. Paper trails\\nand blacktop songs have been my locusts and honey\\nfor so long they're all I know.

I thought\\nI had suffered more than anyone ought to suffer,\\nbut that's what everyone thinks as they fall\\nand stare upward at grayscale sky, but 3 seconds\\nisn't bad—just enough time to identify\\nwho cut you, and where, and why your hands are wet\\nbefore you drift into echo and dark.\\nCaptain Fairbairn taught his soldiers well—how to miss\\nthe ribs and tendons, slice straight and with poise.\\nWe are not all so fortunate as to be trained\\nlike that. I was thinking about the wounds\\nI had dealt, so sloppy, a boxcutter to the bicep,\\na screwdriver to the thigh, always too manic\\nto verify that it was a killshot, or even the right\\nset of eyes flashing pain as I wiped\\nmy weapon and went. A year later I'm grateful\\nfor that graceful draw, the way she slid the blade\\nneatly between my ribs, like she once slid into\\nmy sheets, like she once slid her tongue between my lips,\\nlike she slid her fingers into mine and told me,\\nNow you'll never have to die alone.\\n\\n\\nFLASHFLOOD\\n\\nThese are the days of Plexi-glass and Post-it notes, pre-chewed food choking the aisles, the censored section swallowing the library whole, these are scripts that wouldn't knock the dust off a nun's frock, some happy little trees for your happy little lines—catch us chugging poppy tea in a Brooklyn slum as our rolling papers fold themselves into birds flipped at cabbies and pimps . . . Lorca got mowed down in the street, Dostoevsky faced his rifles, but here in this diet caffeine-free dance party the only one I can cajole into a knife fight is the bearded wino in the mirror, we frightened mice in a city lacking snakes, we batters swinging slow-mo—we're a funny bunch of youths with our noses in decade-old Village Voices, too busy picking lint to catch the word of rough waters barreling down Broadway that we ought to be riding, not photographing from our penthouse lounge. Tony calls from Williamsburg, tells me Michael's doing his coke dance in a room full of coyotes and doves, if I don't get my ass over there they'll stone the piñata without me. I ruffle up my beard and think if we don't stop inspecting the diving board's flex we'll dry up and die, and the kids we tried so hard to warn will watch us fry, and they'll yawn and change the channel, reach for another LaCroix.\\n\\n\\nFINE (in Atrophy)\\n\\nMaybe you'll bruise\\naround the edges\\nand harden up\\nin your core, or\\nmaybe you'll drift\\nout between your teeth\\nlike steam through\\na screen door.\\nI had a feeling\\nyou might need me\\nmore than you thought\\nwhen you left me\\nin that driveway\\nwith twin handfuls\\nof hieroglyphic\\nlove notes you'd passed\\nback across the seat.\\nI watched the way\\nyour eyes caught\\nthe puddle lights and\\ncar horns—you had\\nthat look of, This\\nwill hurt for a long\\ntime, but what\\ncould I say?\\nI wasn't holding\\nthe scalpel, I was\\nthe skin, I was\\nthe body bag and\\nyou were the cement.\\nThere's a kind of sadness\\nso clear it clouds\\nyour eyes and puts\\nwords in your mouth\\nlike, All right, and, Fine,\\nthough the levees are always\\nabout to bleed,\\nthe pillars are whittled\\ndown to matchstick.\\nSince you left me,\\nI've been fine—planning\\non staying that way,\\nno more identifying with\\nsidewalk cracks or those\\nbees printed in urinals,\\nand you can call if you find\\nyour hair flooding\\nthe drain, your lungs\\nturning in their two weeks,\\nand though I'm still\\nfinding new scabs\\nevery time I stop\\nhurtling between\\nflashy gravesites\\nI'll say the words\\nyou want to hear,\\nyou just won't\\nrecognize\\nthe voice.\\n\\n\\nBED-STUY DIY\\n\\nPut a bottle to your teeth\\nin the bathroom or on the roof,\\nwatch crusty punks crawl\\nheadfirst out gray windows\\nto get a better view of\\nthe chainsmoking baby\\nor the dead horse.

Automatic doors\\nyawned as I passed, those beckoning\\ndelis, hotels, banks. I thought,\\nmaybe if I collapse in a doorway it'll be a good\\nconversation starter, but I walked on.\\nNights in foreign cities leave a taste\\nof neon saline through a drip,\\nand all the policemen finger the same coins\\nin their pockets, all the lovers mutter the same\\nholy curses behind deadbolt doors, all the rats\\npray to the same streetlights\\nthough they don't know why.

Vamsi's inside surfing channels,\\nskipping over infomercials and action flicks where the hero\\nalways wins. You're in bed 1500 miles northwest, your head\\na hornet's nest of yoga and Milosz. I don't know what to do,\\nyou say, scratchy through the receiver. I thought I did. I thought\\nI could put enough miles between me and the man\\nwho stepped on that flight, but the past is vapor\\nalways snaking to its source. Everyone tells me,\\nPut the pool cue down, just close your eyes, but my pillow\\nis a six-pack and a carton and a stool. My motel neighbor\\njust pulled up in his jacked-up Ford—his sideburns and pistol\\nsay hello. Hello sideburns. Hello pistol. Hello cat\\nwatching me across the way. Freeway traffic slurs by\\na few hundred feet to my left. I picture your hair\\nbetween my fingers, its grainy wavelength song.\\n\\n\\nPINK MOON\\n\\nYes the tombstones were all watching, yes my shirt was wet from the bar, my knuckles cried for the scene we'd fled, yes she slid her hand beneath my briefs and felt the shiver, we wandered towards the treeline and its dark inviting grin, the pink moon towered over us and all our dead friends, yes she unclasped my belt as I leaned against a grave, yes I gasped and my cigarette fell like a lamp-stricken moth, I squeezed her thighs, she licked my teeth, gray gravel snarled underfoot, city lights sang from the west, yes I fucked her in the graveyard, the pink moon made me do it, our voices were swallowed like barbiturates in the night's slack jaw, we did it in a city of stones, laughing, shushing, starving hysterical naked, I saw it written, saw it said, two land mammals spilling wine and white smoke, avoiding the altar, the furnace, the dirt.\\n\\n\\nTESTIMONY\\n\\nPicture this: ashes kissing paint splattered pants,\\nthin fists slicked with Vaseline,\\ntheir oily trails on fences heading back\\nto my cot on Vermont. That was before\\nI was like this, when green Rorschach dreams\\nacross the sky didn't denote tornadoes, when our faces\\ngrimaced up from freshly laid cement\\nup and down the Corridor. Give me a paper bag\\nand five minutes and I'll show you the many names\\nof nostalgia: barked knuckle shuffles, blood on the dash,\\nSidewalk Slammers—you get the idea.\\nSomewhere on the West Coast all my friends\\nare getting wasted and kicking buckets just like\\nwe always did. We've grown\\napart. We were always stomping through faceless mobs\\nwielding 40s like, Now I have a machine gun, our fingers itchy\\nfor spliffs and loose change. Now it looks like we've all\\nbroken free—we've skipped town and touched down\\nin Midwest basements, tenements in Queens,\\non bridges and balconies, sans parachutes.\\nIt's morning. Today I'll whip up some coffee and eggs\\nfor my girlfriend, head across the river, let the doctor\\npoke my arm and scratch her head. Tomorrow I'll fly east\\nto pick up a car and creep back west, back toward Figueroa\\nand what we buried there. I have a friend everyone warns me\\nis unstable. These days he and I shoot the shit via phone fuzz\\nand plummet into braindead epiphanies like nothing's changed.\\nLast night he told me, Everything I touch curls up and dies,\\nand I pinched my crooked nose and said, Not everything.\\nToday I'll stumble into a pool of gin and juice.\\nTomorrow I'll ogle harried airport eyes.\\nMy name is Jackson Burgess.\\nI've embraced brick walls and pissed in anonymous beds.\\nI love the weird and wild ones. Come save us\\nif you want.\\n\\n\\nFIVE WEEKS\\n\\nDragging off a smoke on the fire escape,\\nso many leaves unfurling just out of reach.\\nYou're inside sipping coffee from a Coke mug\\nas Newman sheds and mauls his duck.\\nWe're here counting seconds and grounds\\nnested in your teeth. I want to lick them out,\\nfeel your palm in the crook of my back,\\nfeel your hair embrace mine, strand by strand.\\nI saw you in the park, smiling and waving\\nto someone over my shoulder. That's when I knew\\nno more blackouts, no more falling\\non my face in rooms full of concerned strangers,\\nno more writing poems in cold dense dark\\non my arms in invisible ink. Oh, you really are\\nwhat it's all about: books and furs and eyelashes,\\nmidnight mania, the salt of sweat on your thigh,\\nthe drum of rain on your roof, pug hair\\nin my underwear. Whatever wisdom\\nBowie and the Stones doled out\\non those blurry winter nights will stick\\nlike dye on fingertips, lights in wide eyes.\\nI will carry you east in my pocket to show\\nthe dealers and derelicts when they creep\\ntoo close and they'll marvel at the sight.\\n\\n\\nSINCE YOU LEFT ME (in Atrophy)\\n\\nThere are so many things I've wanted to tell you.\\nI fought a dog on the corner of 23rd and Magnolia,\\nthough maybe it wasn't a dog, maybe a deer\\nor a dove or a mirror. Here in this blackout cathedral\\nmy friend and I carve lewd things into the pews\\nwith bottle caps we've stashed beneath our tongues, like lozenges\\nthat won't dissolve. I find myself thinking of your elbows\\nand your chipped white nails, the sound\\nof the car door slamming between us.\\nThe girl singing in the Chicago karaoke bar\\nhad your accent so I wanted to take her home,\\ndrive my mouth into hers like a bus into a tree,\\nbut my friend started bleeding from his knuckles—\\nI must have missed him punching the wall, or maybe\\nit was me, I was bleeding, or the blood\\nwas on my knuckles but belonged to my friend.\\nI know, the world is dark and loud,\\nsometimes your neighbor lurks outside\\nwatching you undress, tracing you\\nin the foggy glass. I know, you kiss\\nyour pipe and pass smoke in figure eights\\nwhile I choke on filters, blow through my nose.\\nMy friend's father called again to inform him\\nthat night was the night, no more pussying out—\\nDon't you want to hear my last words?\\nI've wanted to tell you everything—\\nhow I burned my tongue on my coffee this morning,\\nhow I wept for you on the roof, but I don't\\nwant to explain. I watched a film\\nabout men who love life-sized dolls,\\nanatomically correct sex toys they can bathe,\\nsing lullabies to, photograph. You'd have loved it,\\ntheir sighs, their soft smiles. She'll never leave me,\\nsaid one man. I don't have to be afraid.\\nI wanted to sing you lullabies about lilies and weed,\\nabout names and the way they blur and fray.\\nI wanted you to see me dancing\\nin someone's living room, alone,\\nall the party guests wary of the knife\\nI kept waving around. Or maybe\\nthe knife was doing the dancing, the knife\\nwas waving me. The knife's the one\\nwho's been drinking. The knife's been picking up girls\\nin dive bars and making them pay for their cabs.\\nMy friend caught me mumbling in a concert crowd,\\nmiddle fingers to the ceiling in vain—\\nI'd mistaken the bar stools for pews, the DJ\\nfor a priest. He took me outside\\nand his father called, again. My friend didn't answer.\\nEventually one learns to culture neglect,\\nto breathe in dark and exhale figure eights. Hello love.\\nIt's been six months since I last heard your voice.\\nI want to tell you the truth: everything\\nreminds me of you, everyone talks Chicago,\\nthe lilies are speckled with blood,\\nyour blood, my blood, my friend's,\\nmy friend said, Tell me your last words,\\nI'll remind you in the morning.\\n\\n\\nCONNER / RAIN\\n\\nIt's raining and the headlights look\\nlike puddled flash on the cobblestone.\\nMy neighbor started screaming again\\nabout a bat in the lobby so I came outside\\nto watch someone's television glow\\nthrough the window across the street.\\nPixellated faces blur through\\nraindrop sheen as the grass\\nwelcomes footfalls and the gardens\\nwave us off. Sometimes I catch myself\\neavesdropping in my favorite cafe,\\nechoing quietly behind a hand\\nthe way some people hide their chewing\\nor others beatbox on the outskirts of parties,\\nlike my friend Conner,\\nin those holy South Central dumps,\\nspouting kick-snares to the stray cats\\nuntil the cops finally took him away.\\nI've been thinking about Conner, his grin,\\nhis long fingers, the time he wrecked his car\\nand stumbled inside, smashing glasses,\\nkicking the dog, saying over and over, When I die\\nI'll be a legend, a motherfucking boss. The rain\\nis letting up. My neighbor and the landlord\\nchased the bat out. I ought to go back inside\\nand crawl into bed, but the night tastes\\nso tender, the streetlamps know my name.\\n\\n\\n______________\\n\\nBaltimore, MD—March 15, 2016\\n\\nOf course we're dancing over the bridge, of course the cars carving scars through the air aren't stopping to ask where we learned these manic March hymns, the paper mache sky is leaning towards us like a great black bandit sizing up our pockets and the loose change we've stuffed inside, all across the city bedrooms flicker and drown in dark as couples lie side by side passing joints or turning towards opposite walls, the pigeons have no use for us and our haphazard odes to tombstones and trombones, we one-eyed prophets, braindead dreamhounds, all these ambulances blast lullabies for those awake to hear, we're marching into the river, I found a flask in my pocket, it's full of dust.\\n\\n______________\\n\\nWilliamsburg, NY—March 17, 2016\\n\\nI'm making eyes at girls through blue tinted glass in a cafe whose name I can't pronounce, sipping dirt coffee, tapping Tom Waits into the bar, when I realize I'm only a fistful of snow seeping through a pocket, into the smog, into the collective breaths of crazed subway patrons and dancers keeping time to the weight of walking gloom—I'm the man who's traveled east with the Word, but the Word was nothing, and no one gives enough fucks to cup their ear against the traffic's din and let my whisper graze their cheek. These girls look right through me, the barista misspelled my name, the coffee can't moisten my guts, the sun sets over Williamsburg in brilliant folds of blank.\\n\\n______________\\n\\nChicago, IL—March 19, 2016\\n\\nWatching a cop watch me watch him, I'm singing along to the crosswalk's lonely chirp as pigeons make love to deep dish crusts and bits of bark mixed in. Here's the spot on Michigan where you nearly clipped the cruiser, here's the bench that caught me when I watched you drive away. Chicago wind can't drown out the earth's tachycardia beneath toenails painted shades I'll never see. My mouth tastes like yours, which tasted like smoke, which tastes like bright blue light when you catch it in a glass. My train's coming, darling—someone will watch me board and coast away, but they won't burn it into their retinas, they won't hit the nearest bench. I'm reaching out like birdsong, Lily—in time you'll realize all this was about you.\\n\\n\\nDOGS (in Atrophy)\\n\\nGood lord, how those dogs howled\\nthrough the chain links with my blood\\non their lips, good lord the screen,\\nthe screen we punched out to breathe\\nsmoke in the inky night, good lord\\nthe spliffs, good lord the lungs\\non those dogs and our staggerstep\\nwaltzes through summer sweat,\\ngood lord opening my eyes to you\\nin the morning slipping into a pair\\nof my boxers, drinking water\\nfrom a flask, good lord the avocados,\\nthe avocados atop burnt toast\\nand the dawn's cinnamon light,\\nyour tongue against my shoulder,\\nyour fingers in my hair, good lord\\nthe guitar, how it looked in the gutter,\\ngood lord your necklace you forgot\\nagain and again, hanging\\non my corkboard, your scent settling\\nin my sheets, these sheets I cradle\\nmoving slow through dreamy space,\\ngood lord the night we came\\nhome to my room packed\\nin boxes and bags, how we held\\neach other like matches in a book,\\ngood lord how you hurt me\\non the driveway in the rain,\\nthe sirens, the stares, good lord\\nwe cannot be the only ones\\nwho ignore stars in favor of dark,\\nwho pluck strings like gray hairs\\nand shred letters only to tape\\nthem back together, good lord\\nthose dogs, what they were trying\\nto tell us, what we wouldn't hear.\\n\\n\\nLOOSE RIBS\\n\\nIn snow banks and barbeque booths, I'm alone with the heavy gray, hearing my lungs clench and hold. I feel frost burn my nose and I find war in all the miles and I wish you'd do the same. My gloves catch against the lighter's kiss, storefronts stacked with dead farmers' furniture watch me shuffle past. I watch armies and firefall on the television and it's frightening and cruel but still I worry more about you. Who keeps playing hopscotch on my loose ribs? How many more bongs must we smash on the floor? I am selfish and unkind, I filter everything through gloom—these frat kids passing fists, these kids scrounging for dimes. My tongue seeks incisors in a strange woman's mouth and I balk at the taste, the unending edge. I black in outside the Mill and wonder where you are, what you're drinking, whose underwear is going through your wash. It's all firefight tonight, love—if this is a duel, I'll take a bullet to the lung. I'll come home in a year, decked out in paint stains and stripes, hoping to find you high on the couch in underwear that's your own, but I know better than that, I'll knock once and turn to leave.\\n\\n\\nBLACKOUT (in Atrophy)\\n\\nManhattan, NY—March 18, 2016\\n\\nHead out the window of a stranger's smoky car, swallowing sewer grate ghosts, your blood's a scrambled alphabet of dark, you're passing bodies like blouses hung on lines // Now a girl is feeding you salt and pepper chips in a corner store, feel her fingers graze your hairy tongue // You must have run away because this alley is empty and where are all your friends? // Fists high, you're yelling mania at the Google building as tourist buses full of nonsense people point and laugh // Suddenly you're clutching receipts in a saloon plastered in porn clippings and Leather Girl beckons with a pitcher labeled Ass Juice and two shot glasses // You made it to the poetry reading and found your friends but Leather Girl has backed you into a corner, she's grinding you into stacked spines, and where did you go wrong? // Slouched in a subway station bench, Leather Girl's talking about the human condition and her words' blurred lurch has you eyeing the tracks // Someone tied a Get Well Soon  balloon to a homeless man's arm in his gutter slump coma, was it you? // You notice you've lost your friends again, you're alone on the sidewalk with Leather Girl, mumbling to mask your slur, does she want to fuck you or rob you blind? // You don't want to die just yet, here in this glass graveyard, all these grinning strangers or friends, you can't tell // Breathless in the doorway of a bar full of pirates, you must have fled Leather Girl, did she chase you? // All the cars keep yelling your name // This ambulance won't stop following you around // Someone's address is scrawled across your arm, maybe you can find your way there\\n\\n\\nIN THE PARK\\n\\nThe streetlights are fuming and the sky cradles dark. An occasional train sound. Birds nestling leaves. Smoke cut with cinnamon wafts in gray cursive strokes. Across the damp lawn, evening blankets the benches and bricks—the gazebo and its tables, plates and cups. Today marks a year, and if you were here we would slow dance to silence in this aquarium of night, sidestepping the ice spots, alternating swigs. The houses all around us would fold like stacks of cards and the neighbors would crawl out to watch—they'd memorize our sways and saunters, the wrinkles of our smiles, and the streetlights would applaud, the train would creep to a halt, the park would rock in smooth cool time, and we'd be there at the end of it all, breathing each other's air, our steps carving notes in the cement, because ours is a song of sorrow couched in sigh. But your absence holds me down. I smell your perfume on the breeze. My flask is almost empty. I think it's going to snow.\\n\\n\\nCATARACTS\\n\\nIf it's not a car crash\\nit's a finger fishing out a tongue.\\nIf gravity doesn't forgive the drunk\\nthe drunk will forget he asked forgiveness.\\nEvery night is just like this:\\ncar radios roaming streetways\\nlit by orange EXIT signs.\\nHere at the bottom of everything\\nwe watch each other undress\\nthrough grainy cataracts\\nas the thicket sweeps the windows\\nand milk goes sour in the fridge.\\nStray cats fuck in sonorous fits\\nalong the river's frozen spine—\\nit's the frost that holds us together,\\none massive heavy palm.

The whole bar sways with the loose groove of breathless vagrants, this PBR shuffle, fingers drumming love notes in suds, and here's the lonely undergrad, here's the man whose mustache wants to flee his lip, here's the drunk veteran telling me how long it should take a man to pee—You whip it out, do the deed, put it away, bing bang boom—and we're all holding hands in our minds, we're all slow dancing with shadows while the storm watches us slide. Everyone is grateful for the neon lights and the forgiveness they offer, for the carpet and its years of spilled signatures, for the pint glasses and the hands that cleaned them, for the pint glasses and their warmth.\\n\\n\\nDOVES AND SERPENTS (in Atrophy)\\n\\nI spent a long time pretending\\nthat these fists weren't wrapped in cellophane,\\nthat everyone knew my name.\\nOn the bridge I watched a man\\nwatch the river, but the river was ice\\nand the man was a coat on the rail.\\nI've been thinking on the difference\\nbetween clutch and embrace,\\nhow to hold a moth\\nwithout it drowning in dust.\\nBefore I learned how to disappear\\ngracefully in a crowd\\nI threw chairs to assert strength\\nover silence.

Do you see what I'm seeing, Lily? The bricks are tumbling from cracked tar beds and the ground is drowning in white. Faint laughs escape through barred windows into the night. Over the rooftops lights flicker from the mountain's ribs—I wonder who is out there, whether they're wondering about me. In my dream we climb the temple and you shove me from the spire. Now I'm sprawled on the blacktop, pushing through sheets of memories like clothes on a line. The crows hold up the evening, neon signs lure moths and men. With my knuckles barked and my cheek gashed I'm remembering the way my lips glowed when last I kissed you. I wish I could put you in that car, tie your hands to the wheel, make you look back as I did, because I did, and the sky didn't rain fire, the earth didn't melt. The sun whispered dirges too faint to make out and I kicked the gas into the floor. There's a cold wind tonight—do you see it? It's coming for us, Lily. It's scattering us like salt.\\n\\nII. You are tearing holes in my pockets, spitting in my beer; now I have to cut you out of every film and frame. It snowed again and the blue fields glisten, untouched—leaves and human hair tumble across the sheen. I held out my hand all night like a net but caught nothing. In my dream you tip-toe in from Los Angeles with a shovel and a glass, the glass full of nothing—nothing you can cup in your hands, nothing that collects behind your eyes. Now I am collecting everything, all this ice beneath a salt sheet, warm oil rebuking the road. One time over a couple 40s Wilbur told me I was a black hole, that I consumed everything within reach—he had half a beard and a bloodied eye. A hole cannot exist in a vacuum. It swallows to survive. Now I'm watching the treeline just to see what weapons you'll have chosen when you finally descend. You've caught me in a blackout, here in this miraculous pile of nothing—this pit dug out of a pit.\\n\\nIII. This is something you can't have: in my dream your tongue is still in my cheek, your panties in my hamper. From my basement apartment I catch the cries of bedsprings upstairs. The snow abides, silencing the grass, but the moon's stagger through the steeples proves you're still out there, chewing your nails, licking a joint. Is it cold where you are? Are you alone? Lately I've been crawling the walls at parties, my only friend the slow clap of plates in the sink—I close my eyes to see but always open them to rooms full of strangers spitting in their palms. Don't make me remember—now that I have no one to repeat my sleeptalk I'm learning to do it myself. I thought I killed you in the rearview mirror but somehow you keep finding your way back. In my dream my father is reeling in a smallmouth bass, jerking the hook deeper into its lip, waist-deep in green flow. He tells me, Just don't hate her when she leaves. Outside the wind falls flat against sheets of cold slag. Lily, can't you see?\\n\\n\\nAPPROACH / AVOID\\n\\nHer palm on my thigh\\nis a needle in my gums\\nand would you believe it,\\nmy mind's still in Culver City\\nwhere my best friend shatters\\nbottles in his backyard—\\nnot here in this greenhouse\\nof spit and soft flesh.\\nLast month on Figueroa\\nI raised my hands high\\nto angels drawing near—\\nmy friend followed suit,\\nour arms crazed antennae\\nshaky with the booze,\\nuntil the angels were ambulances\\nand we just felt like fools.\\nShe finds my tongue with hers\\nand I'm all tight fists and toes,\\nbent wrongways with the stress\\nlike a waterlogged plank.\\nGood fucking Lord,\\nwhat have we done?\\nWe've left paper trails\\nfrom lovers' bedrooms\\nto our graves.

Watch the way I lather myself in the shower with a stranger's hands, dancing in the suds. When lonely headlights careen down Mulholland, they are begging you for a slow dance, wherever you are. Every graffiti tag a coded love letter, every bus stop a shrine. I thought I belonged here in the gutter with the glass, but none of the pigeons know my name, none of the roaches will give me the time of day. They're all going crazy for you now. Let them. Follow the metro down ramshackle byways, let the bums raise you a glass. Get high and paint the skyline with colors I can't see. Breathe deep the gray surf and accept the waves' haiku. Do this and know I'm sifting through my pockets for scrap paper and pens to let allow my brain to leak. I'll be embracing snow banks I've sculpted into your shape: your cheek bones, your hands, your chest and holy thighs. Undress yourself to this: wind filling my silhouette in our old bedroom, bus exhaust dusting 29th, timid fingers brushing yours. I am picking up the pieces and putting them to bed. These lines may be mobile—you may find them on the breeze or in the rain, but leave them for the mourning doves and trains. I'll light pyres leading to my new home, and the wind will scatter them, and you'll go out walking in your favorite sundress, and I'll make love to ice in the road.\\n\\n\\nPARTY (in Atrophy)\\n\\nThat's me in the kitchen, falling\\ninto the girl with purple hair,\\nstaring out the window at the mob\\nof bodies clad in sweat.\\nMusic like sirens and clash,\\nliquor soaking coarse beards.\\nI am listening for your voice\\nthrough the white noise\\nbut you're not here—you're toasting\\nthe new year in the Midwest,\\nheld by handsome arms.\\nThrowing hands in dark alleys,\\nscrounging for spent butts, I knew my place,\\nI had my philosophies—the roaches\\nheld up the sidewalks, the flasks\\nfilled our coat sleeves—but now the clocks\\nhave stopped singing,\\nthe Valium's in the toilet.\\nEvery morning I see you in my coffee,\\nbillowing with the steam, and I pitch you\\nacross the lawn. We're breaking up.\\nMy cell phone is spewing four-letter words.\\nThese days I scatter condoms like petals\\nacross the bed and gather them back up\\nbefore nightfall. I can't unpack my mind\\nwithout finding dead mice\\nand strangers' thighs. I'm throwing words\\nlike hands, against walls now instead of flesh.\\nThis is sleeptalk apocalypse, burning photos\\nin the sink, flashing strangers looks\\nlike knives, but in an hour I'll be better,\\nI'll strip down and join the mob.\\n\\n\\nGRACE (in Atrophy)\\n\\nMaybe it takes a mirror. Maybe it takes shower fog\\nto recognize the snarl. There is blur at the bottom\\nof any bottle—like last Sunday when I saw a man\\nsmear his date's face with snow. I followed them\\nup Washington, through the park, as gray flakes fell\\nin folds. The man lit a cigarette, his face all wrinkled scorch,\\nand then he stormed away. His date paused and stumbled after him.\\nMaybe it takes a witness. Tonight I watched a cloud\\nof fruit flies descend on my kitchen trash. I raised them a toast\\nas my eyes dried into raisins, my fingernails cracked like glass.\\nMy teeth mumbled prayers against the Iowa chill\\nand I heard yelling in the apartment next door but I didn't knock.\\nWhen everything is finished dying, when the flesh\\nhas turned to soil, it takes the birds still gossiping on the grass\\nand the garbage men running their routes. The crunch\\nof loneliness echoes off book covers, prescription bottles, bare chests.\\nIn bed with someone you don't love, wiping out wine stains\\nwith a dirty sock, it's the words you catch slouching out\\ntowards needy ears that rip the raw veins free.\\nMaybe it's an accident. Maybe it takes a detox stint,\\nor tar. Maybe it takes wrestling the memories you wear like cologne\\nand burying them in snow. Maybe it takes a lungful.\\nMaybe it takes and takes.\\n\\n\\nOUTSIDE (in Atrophy)\\n\\nI keep finding myself loitering in the snow, watching strangers clink their glasses through the window's sheen. In my apartment I'm always scrolling through photos of friends in far places, remembering their tics, their catchphrases and perfumes. The song of skin on skin is always spliced with cold static. My tongue's too scared to speak. I lie in my driveway and watch jets saunter by and wonder if the woman I love is inside, sipping a Coke, adjusting her seat. I want to know why my voicemail won't stop coughing, why my bruises look like smiles. The graveyard is a nightclub, when viewed in the right light. A body is a bullet hole that can't be filled or sealed. Falling is a state of being. I am trying to break the glass.\\n\\n\\nBLACK ANGEL\\n\\nIt was me and August in the graveyard, guiding half a dozen crossfaded poets through the snow-drenched dark, our pockets stuffed with bottle rockets. Night knocked heads with the streetlamps and their luminescent gloom, until there were no streetlamps—no thick beams lighting our way. You can't see scars in the dark, or eyes, or tombstones, so when I tripped over Donovan Francis I ate the ground hard. I wanted to fight Donovan, to tear up his headpiece and toss it out of sight, and then I wanted to give him a kiss. The poets were getting antsy, they said we were approaching the Black Angel, a marvelous bronze statue time had dulled from luster to ash—they said anyone who touched it was followed by death. August and I soon found her, looming in the snow, her wings unfurled like a great dark vulture. The storm raged. The poets shuffled their feet. August embraced her, closing his eyes, pressing his cheek against the frigid bronze. The only ghosts I know in this town are the ones you meet in dreams—exes stroking your arm hairs, lost friends clapping your back—so I don't know if we were followed out of that cemetery, after we lit the fireworks and danced to the racket, after the poets scattered and left us rubbing our eyes, but sometimes I like to imagine a Black Angel is lurking as I fumble with coasters and sit at the bar—I keep a stool open and sip my beer and wait.\\n\\n\\nTHE RIDE HOME\\n\\nCruising down Lake Shore, I'm reaching out the window to clasp blind hands of high rise light. You're hitting turns through tears and skipping song after song to find something that won't urge us to swerve left and breathe waves. Your perfume floods the air against the smoke in my coat—the mixed scents cross, bringing me back to boxed wine on the patio, sex with the windows open, nights dancing out back with the junkies and raccoons. I'm sure you see the pins holding me together, one from each city since I charged the horizon, and I'll bet if you could pull them out, you would. Here we are now, burning in the Chicago cold, holding ourselves back from holding each other, and maybe we'll get hit by a semi-truck, maybe we'll drive through a church, maybe we'll find an empty warehouse and sway to the sound of bodies separating through space.\\n\\n\\nPOSSUM\\n\\nEven after I realize she's not a stray cat skulking in the dark, I'm still holding out my hand, beckoning, cooing like an idiot in the alley, wondering if I let her bite me I'll go to the ER and get filled up with needles and tubes. I read about Krokodil, a flesh-eating opiate that kills the tissue around any injection site, so users have to get creative—the photos showed syringes in gums, in thighs, in the leathery skin between fingers. Most people who try it die within a year so realistically everyone pictured in the article is now dead. Rabies shots and Krokodil are one thing, but what is the nature of heartache, of homesickness or loss? How do you trace the needles no one else can see? When I hold out my hand in a club asking someone to dance, beckoning, will I get sent to the ER, will the flesh of my fingers burn away? When I tell my friends about the possum they laugh and say I've been drinking too much, except my friend in Australia who says possums there are cute fuzzy pests. I want to go to Australia. I want to feel like needles and tubes are unnecessary, I want all the addicts to come with me and chase possums in the park without fearing our bodies will crumble from beneath us and our bones won't mark our ends. Back in the alley I'm scattering fruit and meat and cheese, but the possum has found a new haunt, and I'm mumbling to myself.\\n\\n\\nRETROSPECT\\n\\nI was there when my friend drank the bleach, stark, clean light eviscerating his throat, I was there when the pistolwhip cops burst in through the front, knocking back our neighbors the coke fiends, I was there when the sky shattered like a sheet of glass, a cacophony of cartilage, when the Staples Center leaked formaldehyde and all the homeless scattered, I was there when the drugs ran out, when everyone felt their face melt and scrubbed lines of Braille out of their arms, I was there when the graveyards spat up their dead, when Los Angeles pulsed in gray gridlock madness, when all the bus drivers and businessmen shook hands and danced towards eternal pacifist sleep, I was there when Jack smashed the handle on the curb and we had to run—after we'd ripped up the bathroom and knocked out the guard, the only place to go was my backyard, where we chugged cab and told stories about bad trips and dogs, but there we were, still alive and walking, I was there, I was there when the fires finally died, I was there when the needles crept out of the front lawn and into our heels, I was there when the beatific skyless night greeted us with chopper floodlights, and the neighbors closed their eyes, and so did we.\\n\\n\\n___________\\n\\nNo more pitching rocks through windows, no more needles in the street. No more dumpsters locked from the inside, or shattered pipes, or rags. No red or blue in this new world, no more spray paint tags bleeding down overpasses, slick elegies in code. No more tasers or mace, no junkies knocking on our windows, begging for a quick fix. No blunts laced with coke or lean, no teen hookers smoking on Fig, no danger in this vast flat space where the only sounds are measured footfalls and cars gliding by.\\n\\n\\nRELOCATION\\n\\nWell that settles it: I guess I've got to find another barista to fall in love with, another alley to sleep in now that this one's flooded with possums and snakes. Sauntering down Clinton with my jacket full of tinder, I'm trailing strings of dried up human ears. Here without my criminal friends, none of the benches look as comfortable, none of the dumpsters feel like home, all the grinning strangers are more switchblade than sandbag. I've been trying to scrape the LA skyline out of my veins, with the help of a sympathetic bartender and her surgeon's hands, but it's not working. Watch me turn this waltz into a bare knuckle brawl: left foot, right foot, uppercut, feint. If anyone's got the remedy for Velcro tongue or dartboard eyes, give me a call—this time we're all going to jail, whether or not our fingerprints are found, and these lines may not mean a thing to you, but if they're what hold the screwdrivers and prayers down then I guess they'll have to do.\\n\\n\\nELEGY (included in Atrophy) (revised!!)\\n\\nWe were the ones slow-dancing with streetlamps, fashioning gallows out of bottle and bone, we were singing from the tops of pines, the birds didn't know what to make of us and our scramble towards the sky, we were building walls in the backyard and knocking them down the next morning, on the metro we swam in pools of our own sweat, on midnight treks for smokes we caught rain on our tongues and carried it back home, we were cages of light barreling towards the gutter, the only place we fit, our mating calls resembled quarters in a blender, our path was marked by the string of baffled dog catchers and gas station receipts, the candy in the freezer was not candy, the burns down our arms were not from the stove, the 40s in the recycling were stained with lipstick and piss, we were pipes bare save for resin, we were busted chainsaws, fences full of holes, we were the mad ones, our pockets full of rattlesnakes, our mouths full of cement, our pals were the garbage men and ghosts, we were the haloes around headlights when the sky cried mist, we were white-knuckling on the freeway while earthquakes shook the streets, we were twilight cathedrals crumbling and cold, we were weeping on the pavement when the blackout fell like snow, and we woke up from our dirt nap, in new alleys, all alone.\\n\\n\\nGEORGE'S\\n\\nI'm hatching tallies across my hand as drunk biologists fight in the next booth over and Little League blasts from the TV. The biologists' conversation is equal parts uniformity of tumor dissemination and bullshit, cocksucker! In the back of the bar a man keeps clearing his throat like he has something to say. There's no smoke hanging in the air though it feels like there should be. The bartender is young and has eyes like saucers—whenever I order a drink she won't release my gaze. Now they're playing Johnny Cash and the biologists are swaying like willows. I wonder how many more times I'll have to come here before I'm a regular—I'm sure soon I'll be slouched on the bar or clearing my throat in the back. The bartender just touched my shoulder as she handed me my drink and I flinched. Why did I do that? Are we happy here in this whiskey aquarium? Who is watching us descend into black? The bartender told one of the biologists, You have a hole in your sweatshirt, and he said, No, darling, I have a hole in my brain.\\n\\n\\nSTILL LIFE OF OLD MEN\\n\\nThe drawling soliloquies of drunkards, rambling, belabored, coughing swear words towards a sky they can't see through the crumbling ceiling. Their hands are bricks swinging from twine—they swing them to gesticulate or knock another man's teeth onto the carpet like foam out of a fire hydrant. They speak in hyperbole and parable, like, This one cocksucker copped a feel on my wife and I kicked his balls right into his ribcage. It's been moths since they licked their lovers' necks or made pancakes for their kids. Their evenings are spent between nonsensical litanies against taxes or the blacks and screaming at athletes through the mirror of the TV. Thin gray hair crouches beneath baseball caps too tight for the men's heads. All the wrinkles look like initials carved in trees, but despite the slurs and hurled glasses, past the cocksucker this and sumbitch that, you can see hopeful young men nervously shopping for rings, squeezing their mothers' hands, watching the horizon for something they can't bear to name.\\n\\n\\nPAST LIVES (x) (in Atrophy)\\n\\nThat's right, I was a gum stain on Sunset, I was the tongue that spat it out. I was a tear in a speaker buzzing like a fuse. Everyone shut up. I was lounging in Big Bear when my friend jumped out of a tree. When all the college kids swarmed the bars, I was an expired condom in a wallet, but I was also the wrapper, and the wallet. Listen: I was a moth making love to a floodlight until the morning smacked me down. I was a bouquet of daffodils tossed off the bridge. I was thinking about how many of my friends are dead, or how I would even know. I was watching videos of people putting their clothes back on after sex. I was the clothes and the skin they concealed. I remember now: I was a television in an empty room, I was a mirror marked with lipstick, I was a squirrel stuck in hot tar.\\n\\n\\n29TH STREET\\n\\nTonight Gregory has tumbled from his wheelchair—he's sprawled in the middle of the street, frothing at the mouth, his cock limp in his hands. I know because my old roommate called to tell me, her voice choppy through the blender of my receiver. I can see her now, peeking out the front window, chewing her nails to the quick, wishing she could hold Gregory like a china vase, pry the bottle from his fingers, give him a bed, but no, all she does is call me and sob. The evening smothers everything, settling on the streets, a pool of black ink spilled from the sky over Gregory and his rags, Gregory and his vomit, Gregory, the Saint of the gutters, and I, tipping a bottle of my own, I have nothing much worth saying.\\n\\n\\nDANDRUFF (x) (in Atrophy)\\n\\nfalling into my date's drink and she's not noticing,\\ntoo busy seeking eye contact, pushing\\nher hair back with chewed-up nails.\\nShe takes a sip and as scalp tumbles down her throat\\nI feel my bones sing. There's something electric\\nabout disappearing into another person's body,\\nlike the teeth that rake your hand as you thrust it\\ninto snow, or jolting awake after another\\nfifty story fall. At the party girls were dancing\\nlike fireworks as guys poured shots\\nover their heads. I wanted to be\\nthe alcohol, descending gracefully until\\nit settled beneath crazed soles. I wanted to be\\nanyone else, there in the lungs of it,\\nevery footfall a reminder of where I'd been,\\nevery crack in my voice an echo of someone\\nI'd once heard, but the lights came on, signaling\\nit was time to go, gather our belongings,\\nbeg strangers to take us home. The train\\nsobbed in the distance, and a girl said,\\nShut up already, tossing her bottle in that direction,\\nturning before the glass scattered like mice.\\n\\n\\nEAST (in Atrophy)\\n\\nI have packed my life into boxes and bags and the last thing to go is my beat-up guitar, warped and wet with tears—yours or mine, I can't tell. Here is the trash bag you stuffed my sweatshirts into, here is the crate full of books I re-packed thirteen times. In five minutes I'll drive east with your bobby pin in my wallet and your breath in my lungs. It's hot out but your hands are shaking. Let them. In six hours I'll lie down in a bed that isn't my own, a bed you'll never see. In twelve I'll be swiping through photos, my phone screen torching my eyes in the dark. In a month I'll be blackout in a dive bar, avoiding strangers' looks, taking a shot every time your accent escapes my lips. In two months, a new bar. The same for three. In every new city, every cold night, I'll remember this moment, the wine stain on your blouse, your fingers on my face, the sobs that serve as soundtrack as I drive towards somewhere else.\\n\\n\\nCAUSE / EFFECT\\n\\n3:30am and I'm nursing a beer in my pajamas, watching\\nslow-motion videos of explosions on the internet.\\nIt's mesmerizing, this flowing dance of fire and air,\\nfinally witnessing the sequences eyes are too slow\\nto see. I'm viewer number 12,081,112—it's this popular\\nbecause everyone likes seeing how things happen,\\nhow a combustion engine wretches to life, what\\ncauses what. A few weeks ago in China,\\na dozen men and women clad in black\\nknifed up a train station.

The victims' families\\nmust be dying for an explanation, but sometimes\\nwe don't get that luxury. Sometimes we see lights\\nin the sky, we hear screams in the night,\\nand we aren't given the cause. Sometimes we're just\\nmolecules of oxygen caught in the blast.\\nI'm thinking this over as the alcohol takes effect,\\nas the poison caresses my brain, and it all makes sense.\\nWe're bent on this assumption of cause,\\nlike pouring cream in our coffee, smiling\\nas the black gives way to brown.\\n\\n\\nREPEAT\\n\\nIt hurts to be cut out of photographs.\\nIt hurts to be stabbed in the foot.\\nThere's nothing like the burn of fingernails\\ndown your back, or the red lines\\nof raised flesh that remain.

Sometimes\\nwe open ourselves up just to see\\nwhat's hiding inside our ribcages,\\nwho's dancing in our lungs,\\nbut it's never worth it.\\nIt seems like if so many people\\nhave lived and been hurt, they'd have\\nwarned us, and we'd have listened.\\nI'm just trying to figure out why\\nwe keep touching the stove\\nwhen our hands are already\\ndrowning in spiral scars.\\n\\n\\nPLEA\\n\\nA man with a pitbull followed my girlfriend four blocks\\ncomplimenting her ass until she booked it and fell\\ninto the arms of a flock of fraternity brothers\\nwho did the same thing all the way to her apartment,\\nwhere she called me, scared and tearful, her voice a window\\nshattering through the receiver, me wringing my hands\\nand chugging vodka to forget all the ways in which we hurt\\neach other on the daily: bullies breaking kids' noses,\\npitiless men brutalizing girls, and every thirteen minutes\\nsomeone kills themselves, and every five minutes I'm reminded\\nof how bent we all are on self-destruction—\\nI watch children at the park push each other off\\nthe jungle gym, and crack heads getting thrown down\\nagainst blacktop by power-happy police, and still\\nwe wake up and eat our cereal, we drink our coffee,\\nwe stroll past graves and morgues without a second thought,\\nand I can't fathom the rationality behind stepping\\non your child's throat with all your weight, or burning\\na swastika into your forehead, or spraying a church\\nwith bullets like it's cologne, but somehow people do\\nall of these things, and as a person, that means we're connected,\\nme and the cat-caller, me and the kid-killer, and so are you—\\ndear unknown reader, come grieve with me over the collapse\\nof the world, I've got a shot glass with your name on it,\\nlet's try our best to forget the depravity, and wake up\\ndetermined to give change to the homeless, and write\\nlitanies debasing the cruel—let us go out into the world\\nbearing anything other than cruel plain nothing.\\n\\n\\nDISSOCIATION\\n\\nI don't know how to do this but I want to throw a brick\\nthrough the panes of my eyes and into the roiling gray\\nof my brain, just to shake things up, to get me out of bed\\nand into the wide barren world. I feel like a dog\\nwho's still growing into his own droopy skin, shambling\\nforward towards my own shadow, never fast enough.\\nAll my friends are either parading down chapel pews\\nand filing 401Ks, or serenading themselves with the song\\nof steel on flesh. There seems to be no middle ground,\\nno compromise between ecstasy and despair, and you can see it\\nin the libraries and morgues, in the faint messages scrawled in mirrors\\npost-shower, in the bottoms of pint glasses, the beer suds\\nlike tea leaves begging to be read. These days, I think about\\nPTSD and HIV and SIDS, all these frightening acronyms,\\nand I think about divorce, and sidewalk chalk getting washed\\ninto the gutter along with the dust and grime. It seems like\\nthe best anybody can do is pull out their own teeth\\nbefore self-immolating to ensure no one can identify the body.\\nMaybe scatter those teeth beforehand in places far more interesting\\nthan the lonesome void of a bus stop—maybe the Grand Canyon,\\nor along the Hollywood sign—so you're remembered exactly\\nhow you want to be and not as you are. I guess in the end\\nI'm just wondering how many miles I'm expected to walk\\nbefore I catch up with myself, how many friends I'll have to stop\\nfrom bringing blades into the tub, how many evenings\\nof vodka and gray nothing before I finally meet my reflection\\nand have something more interesting than profanities to say.\\n\\n\\nFALL\\n\\nAnd just like that, it's fall again, and all the trees are dying,\\ndropping their clothes in the street, though I suppose\\nthey're always dying, always crumbling against the wind,\\nlike us, as we bustle through the gray world, sipping\\ntwo dollar coffee and glancing at the morning paper in the trash.\\nWould you look at that: six kids just died\\nin their New York apartment because of a toaster oven, and I'm\\nhoping if I don't think about them for too long, I'll forget—I'll go\\nback to my half-assed dance through the landscape, here\\nin this city made of paperbacks and fire. It's getting colder\\nand here I am again, decked in layers, buckling under\\nthe heavy sky—the same sky that covers us all,\\nnot like a blanket, more like the earth loved ones will scatter\\non our coffins when we're gone. It's funny\\nhow many ways I can think of starting a conversation without\\never trying one out, how I can just sit and smell strangers' perfumes\\nand watch them walk away. As the days get shorter,\\nwe eat less and sleep more, we congregate in churches and cafes,\\nswapping body heat and words, not realizing\\nwe're only waving knives—we're slicing flesh\\nwith every look, with every kiss, with every sloppy tumble\\ntowards connection, it's this crazed need to touch\\nand be touched, to burn and be burned, and just like that,\\nit's raining again, but instead of a baptism,\\nit feels like God's just taking a leak,\\nleaving us barely damp enough to hope for a morning without\\nhangovers or pregnancies, without bedspreads torn\\nand stained, without the urge to leave\\nall our toaster ovens on and bathe in gasoline. Charlie said,\\nInstead of sobbing, write sentences, and that's worked fine\\nso far, but only if it means someone will read this poem,\\njust one person, and find solace in the pain that is living,\\nwhich is dying, which is everything on God's green earth,\\nwhich isn't even green to begin with, it's blue, isn't it?\\nBlue, the color of wrist veins, God piss, sky.\\n\\n\\nPILLAR OF SALT\\n\\nI keep looking back and expecting\\nsomething to be different, more violent,\\nmore serene, I keep thinking I must\\nhave missed a clue or a tip-off\\non the balcony or in my bed,\\nI must have been blindsided\\nby the screwdrivers and Trojans—\\nthey're what stuck with me, the knives\\nI keep finding in my back, so\\nof course they're what I follow\\nhome, to the desolate wonderland\\nthat is South Central, and I watch\\nthe ground behind me for unknown\\nfootprints, and I watch the sky\\nfor choppers cruising too close,\\nand I pray to this bottle and pen,\\nand I hope things will turn out\\ndifferently, but not very often.\\n\\n\\nBLOODMOON (in Atrophy)\\n\\nBarefoot on the blacktop, drink in hand, I don't care\\nabout the way the moon is wreathed in red gas\\nor how the clouds seem to avoid it—I'm here watching\\nonly in hopes that you are, too, out on the quad\\nor on your roof, 1800 miles away, or just a phone call,\\nif I had the guts to twist the knife any further.\\nBut no, I know you're tasting loneliness too,\\nyou told me, and hearing each other's disembodied\\nvoices might make sorrow rise from this steady hum\\ninto a scream—it might remind us that we're each\\nwalking and breathing and living without the other.\\nI hate that we can do that. Here in the flat dark\\nI'm listening to crickets and cicadas call\\nto their mates, God knows how far away. I'm wishing\\nI could call out loud enough for you to hear,\\nthat maybe my voice could ricochet off the moon,\\nthat red mirror of us all, and land at your feet, quiet\\nand self-assured, but no, there's no use pretending,\\nI am not strong enough to do something like that.\\n\\n\\nELEGY\\n\\nI want someone here in this bar to take me home\\nalmost as much as I want no one to ever take me home\\nagain. The place is packed with mumbledrunk\\nold men, sweaty college kids, and me,\\nnursing my twelfth beer, ashamed yet proud\\nthe bartender now knows my name. Somewhere I read\\nwhomever you surround yourself with tells you\\nwho you are, but what if you don't surround yourself\\nwith anyone? What if you scrawl swear words\\nall down your arms and grow your beard out long\\nso no one will approach you? And what if,\\ndespite all this, you still find yourself in the center\\nof the room, leading everyone in rounds of shots,\\nlaughing in spite of the essential ache of being alive?\\nI'm not kidding when I say that every poem\\nis an elegy, because by the time the words reach\\nthe page, whatever they're describing is already\\ngone, so maybe when I look up, I'll have changed\\nmy mind, and I'll ask the bartender when she gets off,\\nand maybe she'll take me home, and maybe I'll smother\\nthe impulse to fake a seizure or pull out a tooth, maybe\\nI won't recoil at the warmth of her hands, shoulders, tongue.\\n\\n\\nVACUUM\\n\\nIt's easy to implode if you really want to,\\neasy to let your guts twist into fists\\nand clench them so tight that the space\\nyou once occupied becomes a shower drain,\\nor the end of a vacuum tube, black absence\\nhungry for matter. It's easy to slip\\nout of your skin and leave it\\non the pavement for somebody else\\nto find and maybe try on—formless,\\nyou can find new ways to punish\\nyourself: creep under doors, slide\\nin between strangers making love,\\nsmell the lubricant, taste the salt,\\nthen retrieve your own skin so you\\ncan continue wishing you weren't here.\\n\\n\\nEVERYTHING IS EVERYTHING\\n\\nA bottle is a baseline is a stretcher\\nslick with sweat. A bar stool worn\\nto bare wood is a puncture wound,\\na three-legged dog. These nights\\nof morbid passion are last wills\\nscrawled in well whiskey and wine\\nwhen we're hauled out back and killed.\\nShot or stabbed, it doesn't matter—\\nbecause a bullet is a blunt knife,\\nwhich is a cock, which is a pill\\nyou chase with Drano and wretch\\nout onto the cement. A poem is\\na city, which is a mass grave\\nturning all at once. A pen is\\na blunt knife is a bar stool is\\na stretcher, it's the way your lover\\nlooks when you squeeze their hand\\none last time and leave.\\n\\n\\nLEAVING THE PARTY\\n\\nIt's the days when you walk into traffic, cigarette\\ndangling from your lip, hoping a semi truck will come\\nbarreling towards you so you can embrace the hood—\\nit's those days that make you pause and consider\\nhomeless vets freezing over steam vents, or babies\\ngetting shaken so hard they die, by parents\\nbarely old enough to purchase alcohol, and you wonder\\nif maybe you don't have the right to hope for death\\nwhen others receive it unwillingly.\\nAnd on those days, it's always the small things\\nthat pull you back down from the scaffolding:\\nconversations with sad baristas, saving spiders\\nand letting them outside, calling up the one friend\\nwho you know feels worse than you, and thanking them\\nfor being alive. Because there's something about living\\nthat unites us, even when we don't want to do it anymore,\\neven when we want to leave the party, but we get dragged\\nback inside, handed a beer, given a punch in the arm..\\n\\n\\nDESCENT\\n\\nIf the alley is your cradle, if you find solace\\nin baptisms of gin and juice, and you arrive\\nacross a table from unmitigated sorrow,\\nthat fleshy ball of tentacles and teeth,\\nthrow back another few pints and shamble home\\nwithout a stranger on your arm, or a dull shiner\\nfrom some belligerent kid, because while no one\\nis alone in being lonely, tossing gasoline on a fire\\nwill never put it out. I've been thinking\\nabout this and other things: like the soft curve\\nof a woman's spine in the sweet dark,\\nor beard hairs rising to the top of my coffee,\\nor fists and faces getting too friendly, blasting\\neach other in great clouds of blood, and I know\\nstaring at dead rabbits for hours is unhealthy,\\nand I know it's dangerous to shower while drunk,\\nbut will someone please tell me the difference\\nbetween ink and lighter fluid, Pepsi and Mace,\\nwill someone please close all the windows and flee,\\nhaving turned on the oven and tied me to the bed?\\n\\n\\nIMMOLATE (x) (in Atrophy)\\n\\nLet's go out late tonight, palming fives to beggars\\nand inscribing lines in every oak we pass, paying\\nno heed to sirens or stares. Last night was only\\ncheap beers alone at the bar and stumbling home,\\nsidestepping exes and ghosts, breaking in\\nthrough my own window because I dropped\\nthe keys in some alley. Let's not over-think this:\\nlet's put a little something in our orange juice\\nand dance in the graveyard, belting out\\nhymns and hip-hop, as if they're the same thing,\\nand people will notice the stench of fear\\ndisguised as elation, and they'll come out looking.\\nLet them come. Hell, let's call up\\nthe mayor, the plumbers, the baseball team,\\nwe'll take that graveyard and turn it into an electric rodeo,\\na firework show that just won't stop, and when the alcohol\\nfinally runs out, leaving us gasping and faint, we'll find\\ncar batteries or antifreeze—anything to keep us going,\\nso blast the music, pour me another shot, come dance\\nwith me here in this room with no windows or doors.\\nLet's try to ward off our exes and the dead—let's light\\nourselves on fire so the last thing we see is bright\\nand warm and alive.\\n\\n\\nGRAVEYARDS\\n\\nAnd there will be no survivors when the flames catch\\nall our old love notes and premature wills. We'll be soft\\nsoil beneath foreign footfalls—unwelcome like an eyelash\\nin the lip of your shot glass you fish out.\\nWe'll all be silhouettes dancing with shadows\\nagainst the walls, but not in a sexy way—more like\\na rigid waltz, stepping in time to the frigid black.\\nLately I've been thinking a lot about futility, and how\\nthis poem will be forgotten in ten years, or two weeks,\\nand I'm trying to be okay with that—with the fact\\nthat someday soon no one will know my name, no one\\nwill care which brand of cigarette I preferred, how hard\\nI fought to love her, because everyone alive will be\\ntoo busy holding their skeletons within, but that doesn't\\nmitigate the heaviness of the now, or the wetness I found\\nbetween her legs, or under my eyes, so here's to the end\\nof all things, here's to graveyards full of folks without names\\nor numbers—beautiful wastelands of light and bone.\\n\\n\\nMILES\\n\\nI'm alone in the diner, eating my burger and thinking\\nabout where you're supposed to look when you're alone\\nin a diner, but mostly I'm thinking about how much\\nI want to kiss your shoulders, in Paris or LA,\\nand how many miles hold us apart, the railroad tracks\\nlike stitches holding the land together, the buildings\\ntrying to reach the clouds, and a few days ago\\nI wanted very badly to die, but rather than fuck around\\nwith pills or boxcutters I went to the bar\\nand played our song over and over until\\nthey kicked me out. Sometimes I catch myself\\nlooking for your hairs in my clothes, and I've realized\\nlately I've been writing a lot of poems about that,\\nbut not enough about the way your body carves sculptures\\nout of the air when you walk, or how your eyes\\nare as warm as the black coffee they resemble,\\nso I'm here thinking all these things, hoping\\nif I get them down right, somehow you'll come\\nsauntering in the front door, and you'll sit\\nacross from me so I'll have somewhere to direct my gaze.\\n\\n\\nFOG\\n\\nI want you to see this: I'm in a dive bar,\\nstuck full of knives and picking at the scab\\non my elbow, trying to ignore your ghost\\nas she sits across from me and smiles.\\nThe bartender keeps coming by, looking concerned,\\nbut he never says anything—he just takes\\nmy order and keeps the beers coming. You've got\\nrain in your hair and on your clothes,\\nand I want to reach out and brush it off\\nbut you're all air and light—nothing I can touch\\nor bring home, nothing I can bite like a carrot\\nor a finger. I know how this will go:\\nI'll drink long enough to forget the knives\\nand your face—I'll take those knives\\nand carve myself a way home, through fences\\ndraped in ivy, and you'll dissipate like fog\\nuntil I wake up, sober and sweaty, and just like\\nevery other morning, I'll reach out to my left,\\ngrasping for your arm, but you won't be there—\\nyou'll be caught in the manic lonely gray\\nthat is my brain, and you'll appear in spirit\\nright when I'm at my most miserable, and you'll try\\nto smile and make me feel better, and I'll try\\nto smile without my face ripping in two.\\n\\n\\nABSENCE\\n\\nWhen I think of you in the city\\nsidestepping oil spots and drunk men\\nhurling catcalls I want to burn\\neverything down—all the supermarkets,\\nall the frat houses, all the cafes\\nserving espresso and kale. I see a girl\\ndrinking gasoline and gathering matches\\nto stow in her medicine cabinet.\\nI see streetlights smothering everyone\\nlike box jellyfish scattering their tendrils,\\ntempting those who notice. I'm trying\\nto explain the ghost limb you left me\\nbut I don't know how. Let's try again:\\nwhen I think of you in the city\\nthrowing back a screwdriver on the 81\\nI can't stop rubbing at my eyes\\nuntil I smell the skin burn.\\nYour bouncing, steady gait:\\nit's what takes you away, out of this gutter,\\ntowards a place where not everything is a tragedy\\nand I'm not there to reach for your hand.\\n\\n\\nSMOKE\\n\\nYou've been living in the front of my skull\\nfor weeks, using my brain as a bed\\nor a punching bag, depending on the day.\\nI've been haunting bars up and down Market,\\ntrying to drown you in gin and Guinness,\\nbut failing. I see you in every shop window,\\nin every empty frame, flashing grins meant\\nto console. There's no escaping\\nthe dumb weight of regret—the flood\\nof what ifs that slouch out of my mouth\\nevery night as I try and sleep.\\nI want to be there, Lily—let me be\\nthe smoke you inhale so I can touch\\nevery inch of your throat, every crevice\\nin your lungs, so you can watch me billow\\ntowards the smoglight and disperse.\\n\\n\\nBAR\\n\\nIn the end it wasn't about love, it was about\\nsharing saliva on pint glasses and beneath\\nsheets. We all picked poison over passion and hoped\\nwe could summon some meaning out of it—\\nbut the smug bartender just kept pouring shots\\nand the only spirits present were those behind the bar.\\nI stepped outside and met a homeless couple,\\nstarved, dressed in shopping bags, who told me\\nabout the bone cathedral in their hometown.\\nI couldn't tell what drugs they were on\\nbut I wanted some. The woman's eyes grew bigger\\nas she described the pews lined with femurs,\\nthe pulpit made of skulls, and when I went back in\\nto tell my friends, no one believed me.\\nSo we drank, some of us to forget, others to remember\\nthe days before prescriptions and addictions,\\nwhen the sun and streets and trees were enough.\\nBut it's never enough. All we have at the end\\nof the night are grainy memories of the floor\\nand how it stuck to our soles, like it didn't want us\\nto leave, like it wanted to hold us\\nuntil time stripped us to bone.\\n\\n\\nYOU CAN'T GO HOME\\n\\nI'm in the muggy strobe light frenzy of a Dublin pub\\nrailing snuff off my left hand because two Swiss girls\\ntold me to, chasing it with the only cider I can afford\\nwhen I realize if I ever make it home, the churches\\nwill have tumbled, the palm trees will have burned,\\nand will she remember me after all these months apart?\\nWill she recognize the boy she drank like wine\\nbeneath all these new wrinkles and scars? The hotels\\nwill be full, the skyscrapers demolished, and I'll be all ink\\nand booze carried by a new receptacle—one with holes\\nwhere eyes, nose and mouth belong. You can't go home\\nbecause earthquakes shatter windows, waves crush\\nbeach homes, knives usher friends to morticians,\\nand you watch your own body warp with the jetlag,\\nwith every handshake and pint, so by the time\\nyou return, you're a walking waterfall in a city\\nof paper mache. But will she remember me\\nwhen she brushes my face, her tissue hands melting\\nagainst the damp flesh—will she still love me\\nwhen my footfalls soak through concrete,\\nwhen I'm a puddle she's learned to avoid?\\n\\n\\nSORROW (sent to SUISS)\\n\\nThere's a deaf scholars' convention going on\\nand the campus bar is silent, save for double claps\\nas mute men order shots and take signed requests\\nfrom their friends. Maybe it's something in the air\\nbut we're all lonely tonight, mourning our exes\\nand giving ourselves Sharpie tattoos of phrases like,\\nLet’s not die just yet, and, Is it too late?\\nEven the plants are droopy: flowers doused\\nin pesticides, leaves dusted with cigarette ash.\\nAll these lit windows full of liquor-fueled love—\\nthe sort that leaves you in the morning feeling like\\na firefly drenched in tar. At the bus stop a man locks\\nthe wheels of a stroller just so he can turn around\\nand punch his girlfriend in the face. He's crying\\nas he does it. In their hostel rooms, bearded men\\nget off on teenage girls posing for their webcams.\\nTired mothers sip whiskey from dollar store flasks, and\\nwe all pass this sorrow along like a cold via sneeze,\\nthough none of us know where it came from, what\\nto call it, how to let it go.\\n\\n\\nBLADES OF GRASS (sent to SUISS)\\n\\nLittle Sparta—July 15, 2015\\n\\nTo become accustomed to the disarray,\\nthe background noise of chainsaws opening letters\\nand toes being ground beneath truck tires.\\nTo grow deaf to birdsong and beehum, or water\\nfalling over stone basins onto rocks—to witness\\nthe water and only see a force smashing an object,\\nmuch like a jackhammer does a sidewalk.\\nTo smell exhaust in meadows\\nand sewage in stone monuments—everything\\nis just atoms collapsing into themselves, anyway,\\nbut you can't help it if your eyes become glazed over.\\nSheep fields or minefields. Statues or scalpels.\\nEvery blade of grass wants to slice your tongue\\nso you can't speak of what you've seen if you return.\\n\\n\\nKILN\\n\\nSidestepping officers through tar-black night\\ntaught me to clutch keys between my knuckles\\njust in case push came to shove. The churches\\nand liquor stores etched the bags under my eyes,\\nwound my vocal cord like a grandfather clock,\\nturned my tongue into a razor rather than\\na sheath. And all the drunken brawls and nights\\nheckling stand-up comedians were only the aftermath—\\nthe vestiges of therapy sessions gone wrong.\\nI started dodging cops, then construction workers,\\nthen librarians, then friends knocking at my door, saying,\\nWe know you're in there, come on out.\\nOne by one I'm losing my spare house keys\\nin the skulls of innocent strangers. I'm burning\\nmy own arms, mistaking them for bridges.\\nAnd if you're hearing this then you're like me:\\nscared of shadows and birds, gritting your teeth,\\nbraced against the door. I know this\\nis mostly withdrawals and anxiety talking,\\nbut knowing a monster's name won't stop it\\nfrom flaying you, draping your corpse over a streetlamp\\nfor the kids to see and say, Gee, what's he doing up there?\\nWhy won't he come down?\\n\\n\\nMURMURATION\\n\\nOne night my friends busted into a church\\nand broke the high windows, the colored panels\\non the walls, and then they smashed their bottles\\nand left. I like the thought of their beer-tinged shards\\nmixed in with Peter's left foot, Jesus' scalp, all\\none mess of shattered frenzy—like starlings drenching\\nthe sky in waves. It's called a murmuration,\\nwhen the birds do it. They flock by the thousands,\\none leviathan spawned from many small, scared things.\\nAugust wrote a poem about the army ants' death spiral,\\nwhere they march in a whirlpool until their thin legs\\nbreak from beneath them. We murmurate in airports\\nand at downtown bus stops, brushing shoulders and pretending\\nwe don't notice, or dancing in the steaming bellies\\nof clubs whose names we don't remember. Every cocktail\\nis a murmuration, like the contents of our stomachs,\\nor the signals jolting through our brains. I like to think\\nthat if we had a 60-second video of all of humanity,\\nfrom beginning to end, it would look like a bunch of dancers\\npirouetting in perfect time and not like a spiral of suicidal ants.\\nI like to think we're all moving in the same direction,\\nwith stained glass under our feet and not at our throats.\\n\\n\\nLILY SAVES BEES\\n\\nwith sugar water when she finds them dying on the sidewalk,\\nsprinkling it like holy water on churchgoers' heads. I kill\\nblack widows whenever I find them. I hope Lily would approve.\\nIt's funny the way people seep into us, like smoke into cotton,\\nor Valium into blood. We pick up accents and gaits,\\ntremors and fears, stories we tell ourselves so many times\\nwe come to believe they're ours. Lily doesn't wear makeup\\nbut you wouldn't believe that if you saw her. She likes\\ndaydreaming about the Apocalypse and how many people\\nare surfing or having sex or falling down stairs\\nat any given moment. I like turning off my brain like a lamp\\nand wondering where I am, how I came to inhabit this cage,\\nhow many flights of stairs I've tumbled down before\\nhitting solid ground. When Lily strips and comes\\ninto my bed, I hold her like a glass brim-full,\\nand I always spill, and she likes it.\\n\\n\\nCIGARETTE\\n\\nCelebrate the past in drags: one for every balcony\\nwe didn't leap from, one for every pitcher spilled\\nin the dank fumes of the pub while the bartenders\\nlaughed and called us names. I'll smoke mine here\\nin Virginia, my only company the June beetles,\\nand you do yours in Los Angeles, that city where\\neveryone goes to die. I had a dream you and I were\\nswimming out into the Pacific, and the sharks tailed us,\\nwaiting to see how long it would take for us to run out\\nof breath, but we didn't—we just swam and swam\\ntowards a shore that wasn't there to begin with,\\nso we turned around and swam home. Every morning\\nI wake up and burn my palm trying to light a damp cig,\\nwhile coffee bleeds into the pot, just inside. I see last October\\nand its tentacles: the prescriptions, the questionnaires,\\nthe fist fights our friends had to tell us about later\\nbecause we were checked out, too busy drowning\\nin spirits, trying to pummel our own reflections,\\nbut we survived. Take a drag for that,\\nand the battery acid we didn't drink, the bones\\nwe didn't shatter on four-story falls. Take a drag\\nfor the holy water we left coursing down our arms.\\nAnd another. And another. In Los Angeles\\nearthquakes sob along to cracked guitars\\nwhile bar floors mourn the drought, and the city sleeps\\nalone tonight, as we burn elegies into our palms\\nfor each other or ourselves, for the black eyes and bad lungs,\\nfor anything other than tomorrow.\\n\\n\\nFLOOD\\n\\nHey look: I'm chewing off my fingertips, I'm rubbing vodka\\ninto my eyes just to keep awake. I'm dancing with morphine sticks\\ndisguised as friends and waiting for the moon to stop singing\\nso many dirges. Really I'm waiting for myself to stop.\\nThe roads are looking more and more like canvasses torched\\nand I'm always the one holding the torch. I'm trying to mow the lawn\\nwith a chainsaw and I can't stop. I'm building scaffolds\\nwith cigarette butts and trying to climb them. I'm swarming\\na streetlight like a gnat in a cloud of gnats, and the only solace\\nis that none of the others know how to stop either. We buzz like that,\\nand every once in a while one of us gets zapped, and we watch her fall\\nand hit the ground and stop. We wait for the rain to come and sweep her\\ninto the gutter, where she'll cruise into the sewer, and where eventually\\nwe'll follow.\\n\\n\\nEXILE / HOMECOMING (x)\\n\\nSitting on an Arizona gravel lawn half-past eleven\\nI thought about where it all came from: one big rock\\nshattered and tossed across a thousand yards.\\nAnd then I wondered if I was sitting on one big rock\\nor a thousand small ones. Or how when I take a drag\\noff my cigarette, I'm really inhaling dozens\\nof burning plants, that were maybe lined in a row, maybe not,\\nbut it all comes together. When does paper stop being a tree,\\nor when do I stop being the one writing this poem?\\nJackson, come home, Lily said. Jackson, please.\\nThat's what I used to say to myself whenever I stepped\\nout of my body and wouldn't step back in. I read that van Gogh\\nsent his girl part of his ear. Was that his best attempt\\nat coming home? If he'd sent his hand or his head,\\nwould that have been closer? The gravel is gravel\\nbecause it's no longer a boulder, the tobacco stops\\nbeing a plant once it's rolled, but how many appendages\\ndo I have to chop off before I stop being me?\\nJackson, come home. Jackson, we're tired. Jackson,\\nI hate you, I love you, Jackson, I can't tell the difference.\\n\\n\\nNOVOCAINE (x)\\n\\nI'm back from the dentist and the bottom half of my face\\nis just rubber stapled down—fleshy pulp that moves\\nbut doesn't feel. When I speak I'm a four-year-old\\nand the drive back home was terrifying—not the thought\\nof a crash, but the thought of trying to explain myself\\nin blabber speech to an amused cop, or praying\\nover a dying stranger, making him leave this world\\nto a soundtrack of, I'm so sowwy, over and over.\\nI'm pretty confident I could bite off my lower lip\\nwithout feeling it, but I'm not brave enough to try.\\nI don't know what I'd do with it, anyway: put it in ice water\\nand drive to the ER, or just sit and hold it for a while?\\nThe upside is that, for once, I can feel how my face feels\\nto others: the slant of my jaw, the push of my tongue\\nagainst my own arm. That must be how it felt for you, Lily.\\nI finally know how your fingers cruised through my beard\\nand across my lips. I wanted to call you up and tell you this,\\nbut didn't, because I didn't want to relay it in blabber speech.\\nWhether or not I bite off my lip, at least I have this:\\na pen, a page, your fingers brushing my beard\\nfrom five hundred miles away.\\n\\n\\nATROPHY (x)\\n\\nMore and more I feel like the bits of tire left\\nin skid marks on the freeway where people crashed\\nand maybe died. Or the blood I rub off\\nmy fingertips as I crush this mosquito\\non my thigh. More than anything, I feel like\\na bathroom trash bin full of toenail clippings,\\nor the clippings themselves. If dust really is\\nmostly skin particles, I wonder how much of you\\nis left in my old room, Lily, on the now empty\\nbookshelves and floors. I know you feel the same:\\nlike no one will ever notice the bits of your lip\\nleft on theirs, or the hairs you leave in their suitcases\\nwhen they pack up and go. The ink left on margins\\nafter a pen is tested out. The smoke lodged in fabric.\\nThe brain tissue killed with every swallow or puff,\\nand the memories that go along, and the memories\\nthat remain.\\n\\n\\nSTARS (x)\\n\\nToo much coffee too late at night has got me doing handstands\\nin my brain, trying not to dislodge neurons or knock over\\nbottles. I want to go outside and punch anybody\\nwho looks me in the eye. I'm joking. I want to punch\\nmyself in the eye until my face is half raccoon and half\\nhomeless beard. If I sound like I'm scared\\nit's because I am. I've been talking to God nonstop\\nsince I had that dream where for a moment I forgot\\nmy name but I haven't gotten any response.\\nOnly shards in my soles and that truck full\\nof manikin parts that drove by and somehow felt\\ncrucial—like maybe I could take one of them out\\nfor a drink or a smoke and learn something\\nabout what it's like to be drawn and quartered,\\nwhat it's like to be stared at nonstop for hours.\\nI want to be a manikin. I'm joking. I want to be\\nsomething other than this fleshy mass of nerves\\nsquirming too fast to fit in my own skin. While everyone\\nwas out sipping wine and playing charades, I was in the dark\\nmixing cocktails out of beard hairs and dirt. I'm joking.\\nI was in the dark talking to God and waiting\\nfor someone to remind me of my own name, to apply ice\\nto my eye and say, Listen, we're all dying. Why not do it\\na little more gracefully? The stars feel colder\\nwhen you shed your liquor jacket and watch them\\nnonstop for hours. They laugh like they know something\\nyou don't. They want to destroy you. They want you\\nto hurt. I'm joking. They want to remind you\\nthey're already dead.\\n\\n\\nSTILL LIFE OF LILY (x)\\n\\nAnd there was love in the fingernail clippings, and the feathers,\\nand the waist-length hairs you left draped across my pillow,\\nlike power lines downed by a tree. And I said terrible sad things\\nto you while you were asleep, and I repeated them later on\\nto the bathroom mirror, after you'd already brushed your teeth\\nand left. And there was love in the flasks of Fireball,\\nand in the toilet bowl's warmth right after you'd left it,\\nand there was love in the ants out back,\\ndragging stray pieces of glass away from their hills,\\nso carefully, so tenderly. I took notes on their movements,\\nwishing I could touch you in the same way. And you said\\nyou'd never cried in your life, the morning after you sobbed\\nand left stains all over my mattress, the morning after\\nI said terrible sad things to you, thinking you were asleep.\\nAnd I fell into other women's beds, and I drank\\ntheir perfumes, but despite my best efforts, they all tasted\\nlike you. And I drank myself into a coma. And you smoked\\nenough weed to kill a bull. And I scooped up all the remnants\\nand stray pieces of glass and built this bouquet of words\\nthat will never be enough. And so I tried again.\\n\\n\\nEGO DEATH (x)\\n\\nThe hearts of men flutter and fail, they creep out\\nthrough dry throats and just sit there on the pavement\\nlike eggs that won't fry. These are strange days in LA—\\ntoo many manhunts and transports, too many kids\\nbusting each other's faces, reenacting gore portraits\\nthey've learned at home, or out on the tracks\\nafter dusk. Lately I've been stranded in angry mobs,\\nholding unpinned grenades that for some reason\\nwon't explode. I've been boxing in halls of mirrors,\\nsmoking spliffs with vagrant zombies who creep around\\nmy neighborhood. The kids don't stand a chance—\\nby six they've learned the art of the laying on of hands\\nand all its intricacies: the graceful arc of a punch,\\nthe orgasm of crunched cartilage, the baptism\\nof drowning in one's own blood. My skin's not thick enough\\nto ward off the needles, or the hollow points dancing\\nup and down my street. You are here, the sign says,\\nplacing me with a red arrow at some intersection\\nin some neighborhood I don't know, but it's wrong,\\nI'm in a 40 on Vermont, I'm in pistols down Slauson,\\nI'm in a book in Doheny Library—the one about Pluto,\\nwhen he was still a planet, when he still mattered.\\n\\n\\nESCAPE PLAN\\n\\nWhenever I see planes cruising out of LAX I jump in\\nand imagine looking downward at my house,\\nwhere I'm going, where I've been, what I'm running from,\\nwho's chasing me. It's usually a girl whose tongue\\nI've accidentally bitten off, and she usually has needles\\nor knives, something sharp—never blunt, never as easy\\nand senseless as a hammer or brick, because\\nthat's not how heartache works. I thought I was getting better\\nat amputations, but there's no such thing as a clean break\\nor a smooth getaway, which is why every attempt at escape\\nvia flight ends in catastrophe: the man sitting next to you\\nhas rabies, you fly into a cloud made of ice,\\nyour brain suddenly ingests itself, and still you try,\\nyou practice pillow talk and sweet nothings, you go through\\nall the motions, knowing it will end, knowing someone\\nsomewhere will have you placed on a bed of nails\\nand lay themselves on top of you, delicately,\\nstroking your face as they push and push.\\n\\n\\nLILY\\n\\nI'm glad you've found me here, eating cigarettes in this pile of trash, counting my fingers over and over to make sure I'm still intact—you with your sonata smile and dry ice heart you smother in rolling papers and ash. And I'm glad you understand the nonsense I spout in my sleep, the jerky waltzes I thrust into your chest. You've read the Braille behind my black eyes, the botched Neruda that escapes my lungs with every smoker's cough, and I'm glad when I run, you know not to chase me. Lily, you're what the Vikings saw the first time the Aurora Borealis knocked them to the ground. You're clean white bone hiding beneath scorched flesh, and the rain, and the gauze. I'm glad you caught me when my tightrope snapped, I'm glad you spread your arms wide enough for me to fit inside. Lily, I'm scared. Lily, am I coming through to you? Can you tell me what happens next?\\n\\n\\nFORGETTING\\n\\nI'm sad to leave LA because on the sunny days\\nI don't miss you. That's what Caroline said\\nthe day I lasered her name off my shoulder—\\nthe same shoulder she used to nestle into\\nlike a bird in deep foliage during a storm.\\nShe offered her hand, all scarred up and raw,\\nbearing tooth marks that matched my canines\\npoint by point, but this time I didn't bite; instead\\nI pulled a switchblade and sliced her to the bone.\\nAnd now, no matter how many times I cut myself\\nin the same spot, it won't be enough to push the blood\\nback into her veins. I worry everything I touch\\nturns to dust—like my friend Michael, when he tried\\nto pull a moth out of the shower, gently, in a cradle\\nof toilet paper, but instead of saving it he just\\ncrushed its wings and let it fall. Some nights\\nI drink to forget the wreckage I've left\\nin my wake, feeling like an oil tanker\\nshattering crystalline icebergs, not on purpose,\\nonly passing through. I've walked through the fire\\nwithout any burns, but those I've tried to bring with me\\nhave become the ashes drifting off my cigarette,\\nand the only consolation is drunken kindness,\\nspare change for the homeless, advice for Michael\\nand the others, but there's no truth in a shot glass.\\nNo beauty in a bottle. Only ghosts wielding switchblades,\\nand bite marks, and blood.\\n\\n\\nBRICK WALLS\\n\\nWhen my therapist asks me why my knuckles are all bruised\\nI don't know which will sound worse: the lie\\nthat I've been fighting strangers again, or that I've picked up\\na nervous habit of dragging them across chain links and bricks\\nuntil they bleed. I was sitting in her office thinking about\\nwhat in the hell psychic death could possibly mean, when I remembered\\na talk we'd had in class about Goldfish crackers—the way companies\\nanthropomorphize them, slapping on eyeballs and smiles, and somehow\\nthat makes them so much more desirable. My friend said that ever since\\nwe were cave people, we've had an innate desire to kill, so biting\\nthe head off a fish that resembles a human helps fulfill that desire.\\nI wish I had the memory of a goldfish, so I wouldn't remember\\nall the times my head has been bitten off. My therapist\\npulls up my weekly mood chart and statistical likelihood\\nof suicide, but I don't want to look at that. I want to look at her\\nroot beer eyes, or that loose strand of hair dancing under her nose.\\nI can't help but wonder, Does she have an innate desire\\nto kill me right now?, but I don't mention that. Or the Goldfish.\\nI just talk about how I've been punching brick walls\\nand how good it feels to exert all that energy into nothing at all.\\n\\n\\nDREAM\\n\\nLast night I had a dream my brother and I were both maimed in a war\\nand rather than go on living, we each took a dozen barbiturates\\nas an act of solidarity, but then our parents took us to the park\\nto see fireworks, and we both decided we didn't want to die after all.\\nWe had to keep each other awake, as we nodded off\\nto death's Siren song, but I knew that even if we both\\noutlived that night, there would be another, and another.\\nThat's when you called and woke me up. It was you, Margot,\\ntelling me you had been maimed and needed help—but this was\\nreal life, and you were in LA, and I was in Arizona,\\nthrashing in my futon downstairs. So I sent you a poem,\\na bunch of pixilated hash marks on a screen. I couldn't help\\nbut wonder: am I the one you think about\\nwhen you drink yourself to sleep, or when the army ants swarm\\nyour throat? Do you mutter my name as he moans yours\\ninto your mattress—the very same one we once burned?\\nMy brother's in Baltimore, I think he's doing all right,\\nI don't think he's counting barbiturates, at least not yet,\\nbut I know you, and I know the way a person's voice breaks\\nwhen they're doing just that. I want to be there, Margot,\\nI want to be the stomach pump, or the water under your feet\\nas you walk and don't plummet, as the reefs beckon,\\nyet you turn them down in favor of the shore, though I know\\nthere will always be another reef, and another, and the world\\nis very large—too large to wander without an occasional IPA\\nat the crossroads of what was and what won't be. So I'll smoke\\nmy cigarettes, and I'll scrawl my frantic lines, and I'll wait\\nfor you to call back, like an echo through the fog. I will wait\\nuntil my shoelaces stop looking like nooses, and you stop looking\\nfor some source of light, because it's you, Margot. It was always you.\\n\\n\\nBEES\\n\\nGilbert, AZ\\n\\n3am on a bench outside the church and I'm basking\\nin the sudden loneliness of it all: the headlights blazing past,\\nthe birds calling to each other from one side of the park\\nto the other. I have no friends in this town—no one to call up\\nfor a drink or a smoke, and I'm feeling a bit like a honeybee\\nthat's been dragged a hundred miles from his hive because\\nhe accidentally flew into a car full of roadtripping college kids.\\nI can't tell if it's good or bad, this encompassing peaceful doom,\\nlike fog rolling off the Pacific, prefacing a storm. My friends\\nare drinking in Los Angeles, tossing logs onto a bonfire,\\nwhile I watch the moon and crave a bottle of wine I know\\nI can't have. The jets cruising miles above me are full\\nof honeybees. My head is full of hornets, and I hope I have enough\\nsmoke left in my reserve pill bottles to calm them. Morning comes\\nlike credits at the end of a movie, cascading downward, possessed\\nby gravity, and maybe I'll sleep on this bench and wait\\nfor the cops shoo me away. Maybe I'll break into the church\\nand perform the Sacrament prayers the priests nailed into my brain,\\nbut that would be sacrilege—as if my very presence in this town\\nwasn't enough of a slap to the face for all the sleeping families,\\nblissful in their fidelity, waiting for Jesus to come and rid the earth\\nof bummy college kids contaminating the air they breathe. Because\\nwe don't all harbor nests of hornets within our skulls, we're not all\\nbees stranded in strange lands, and most of us can't even\\nrecognize each other, even if we pass, lock eyes and nod.\\n\\n\\nZIG-ZAG\\n\\nAfter Aesop Rock\\n\\nAnd when the flashflood came it carried masks and matchsticks, it dropped boxcutters into the hands of bums and businessmen, who looked at each other and grinned. Skid Row glitched through time and gave birth to twenty thousand ghosts, and the slacker tabloids barely noticed, busy with their murderous diversions, sleeping and laughing, settling down with cold beers while goblins wandered the streets, harboring bad shiners and casting black shadows against the slick great wall of the city. Los Angeles: a mound of toothless skulls, a symphony of shackled radios and kamikaze assholes screaming, Fuck off, to nobody in particular. When the flashflood came, I was sitting on my fire escape, where I could watch all the jackals and badgers flatline along towards their neat little graves, alone together, bereft and empty after the wonderful atomic nothing.\\n\\n\\nGHOSTS II\\n\\nIn the Caribbean I learned from a book how to repel ghosts:\\nyou pull your pockets inside-out and for some reason\\nthat keeps them at bay. I tried it last night but they wouldn't stop\\ncoming—ghosts plucking at my beard, sticking me with pins,\\nbegging to be seen. I wonder if I can avoid the Holy Ghost\\nwith the same technique, but I doubt it. He'll be right there\\nwith me, shambling into the chapel on Easter Sunday,\\nor falling into my toilet as I lurch out the remains of the day.\\nI've noticed lately I keep writing poems about a mean God,\\nand just now, right as I was jotting this down, the voice\\nthrough my earbuds crooned, The bully always wins.\\nI want to be the bully, I want to suckerpunch kids\\nand decapitate all the stray cats, but instead I find myself\\nfishing for recyclables in my dumpster because Smokey's arthritis\\nis flaring up again. None of us will survive, I know that,\\nwe'll all end up in coffins and urns, except God, who will just sit\\nand watch it pan out. Maybe he's lonely, maybe that's why\\nhe felled the towers and leveled New Orleans, because\\ncruelty is just another way of begging to be seen.\\nMy friend eats meat to assert his dominance, like, Ha ha,\\nstupid cow, you thought you were better than me. I break up\\nwith anyone I've dated for longer than a month, maybe\\nwith the same logic. The ghosts of past lovers\\ndrag me out of bed every morning, guiding my hands\\nas I warm up the coffee and munch on toast, and then\\nwhen anybody else enters the kitchen, a roommate or a girl\\nI thought I'd left asleep, the ghosts slink off, giving me the finger,\\nmuttering, I never knew you, I never knew.\\n\\n\\nDOMINOES\\n\\nJoey's got weed and Xannies he sells on his free time\\nbut we don't really talk about it over the picket fence—\\nusually he just makes fun of the things I shout in my sleep\\nwhen I leave my window open, or we hash out the old\\nBiggie/Tupac debate—but today I saw him selling\\nto the skater kids up the street and had to call him out.\\nI watched the dispensary up 29th get raided by the DEA\\nso now Joey's probably coasting. I also watched him punch\\nmy best friend in the eye in my foyer. Things got a bit hazy\\nafter that, but my other friend Zach turned klepto for a minute\\nso Joey hit him too. Zach stole three bikes in two days\\nand wanted to stash them behind my house, and I said no,\\nbut only because I knew my roommates would throw a fit.\\nWhen I think of the company I keep, I imagine pills\\nand boxcutters, beards and holy water, bottles and cans\\nthat Smokey will fish out of our dumpster to load up\\ninto her sack. Her face is a car crash paused right at the moment\\nof carnage. When I told her LAPD had dragged out\\na homeless man downtown and shot him in the head, she cried.\\nI should have cried. I might've known the dude. But I didn't.\\nI swore I'd take the strait and narrow, I swore I'd walk\\ntowards the light, but how can I help if I pull shadows\\nthe way Smokey pulls recyclables, or Joey pulls Xannies\\nto palm to skater kids? We're the Island of Misfit\\nManic-Depressives, but this is not an exclusive club.\\nThere's no bouncer here. Wipe off your makeup and befriend\\nsome pigeons—you can join the Church of the Broken Bottle,\\nthe Church of the Band-Aid, here where we get frisked\\nand fucked and lost on the daily. We've been waiting\\nfor the End of Times forever. When God lights up the sky\\nin seconds and we watch Los Angeles tumble like dominoes,\\nwe'll raise our hands high, middle fingers to the steeples\\nin vain, because we saw the grand finale in cigarette burns\\nand street people long, long ago, but there was nothing\\nwe could do or say to stop it.\\n\\n\\nA FAILED BALLAD (x)\\n\\nI'm on my back in the grass, watching jets slice the sky\\nlike brushes on canvas, or razors on skin. Someone's singing\\nballads across the park, but I can't make out the words.\\nA cloud the size of Los Angeles swallows up the planes\\nand part of me wishes it would fall like a cinderblock,\\nknocking us all deep into the earth. There are things I remember\\nand things I forget. I can't remember the last thing you said,\\nbut it was probably something sweet, some inside joke neither of us\\nwould find funny anymore. A couple weeks ago at a party\\nI hit the lean hard, and, stumbling home, I tried to befriend\\nsome dogs through a fence. They mauled my hand and now\\nmy bed is covered in blood. It won't wash out. It never does.\\nI guess the end of winter means the beginning of something new,\\nbut everything is always happening, anyway, so here we are now,\\nsipping coffee in Founders Park, here we are laying in bed,\\ntalking Kerouac and doing our best Louis Armstrong impressions,\\nand here we are in ten years, trying hard to figure out\\nwhy we always reach through fences we know we shouldn't.\\nLast night I choked on Valium and watched a special about giraffes—\\ntheir tongues, their girder necks they swing like clubs\\nwhen they fight. At the end of the show, a mother was defending\\nher child from a pride of lions, and she looked as if she might make it,\\nstomping a wall around the baby, but then she stomped her child\\nin the head. She stood there and then looked downward, slowly,\\nto see the mess she had made. And then she ran, her pitiful skull\\nswinging on its bean pole, her voice silent because giraffes\\nare silent creatures. We are not silent creatures. I wish\\nI could sing ballads, but all I can muster are these lines,\\nthese desperate slashes across paper, like vapor trails behind planes,\\nor the scars we leave on each other's hands every time we embrace\\nand drift apart.\\n\\n\\nDISSOCIATION\\n\\nRinse, dry, repeat. Valium, lithium, booze, dandruff flakes\\nfalling into my date's warm mimosa, and there you have it,\\na dartboard of cacophonies, a graveyard of tallies\\nSharpied across my hand—all these reminders\\nthat I've become everything I was taught to hate. The mirror\\ninforms me I'm no longer me, and from within\\nthe glass I watch myself step into the shower\\nand blast scalding streams until the hot feels cold.\\nMost days you can find me shaking my fist\\nat the sky, thinking of something to say,\\nbut all that comes out are four-letter words.\\nYou can see me standing on my own chest,\\ncracking ribs, guzzling Promethazine like iced tea.\\nI pull out onto Vermont with a shotgun\\nin the passenger seat, no, that's not a shotgun,\\nthat's my friend, no, that's me, hurling eggs\\nat pedestrians and blaming the driver.\\nSometimes I wish I could kiss myself\\nso I could bite out my tongue, but that\\nwon't work, that would be too easy.\\n\\n\\nVITAL SIGNS (x)\\n\\nHow many heads can you fit into one oven, wait,\\nthe better question is how many can you pull out\\nin time? I found my friend making a gin and antifreeze\\ncocktail but before I could slap it to the ground,\\nI heard my roommate waterboarding himself\\nin the bathroom. All the nooses have been cut,\\nall the knives hidden away, but still we find ways\\nto self-immolate, to choke on our tongues, to kick\\nbuckets so hard we break all our toes. This is going to hurt\\nfor a long time, I told my friend as I punched him\\nin the jaw, with just enough force to knock the pistol\\nfrom his hand. Let the ambulance come, let the pills\\nand vodka flood the toilet and not your veins.\\nTake those veins and wear them like a coat\\nof many colors, far more blue than red, far less\\nsedated than alive and living, yes, living, despite that\\nwe're all dying on our own terms. When Renee died\\nshe did it in her wheelchair and I think that's sort of beautiful.\\nI caught myself burning a hole through the back of my hand\\nand with that hand I punched a hole in the drywall\\nso my friends wouldn't have to. I drank the antifreeze,\\nI spat out the teeth, but who's going to catch me when I drop\\nlike a pheasant full of birdshot? Some days I'm the trashcan\\nand some days I'm the lint. It's all perspective. Flared lenses\\nsmacking us with red eyes. Body bags with names\\nno one can read. Maybe we'll drive to Big Sur,\\nmaybe we'll hit every bar down Fig, maybe we'll walk out\\ninto the rain and swallow ourselves whole.\\n\\n\\nAND TO DIE (x)\\n\\nBaltimore, MD\\n\\nOn my friend's balcony I was trying to kill\\na cigarette in one hearty drag, in a blizzard,\\non three prescriptions, and as the wind nudged me\\ntowards the plummet, I thought, this is how\\nI want to die. But not now, not before I've skinned\\nmy kneecaps in twelve more cities and fallen in love\\nhalf that many times. I spent an hour on the wharf\\nwith a homeless guy who told me his life story\\nover and over, each time giving his siblings\\ndifferent names, and we took turns sipping\\nshitty coffee as I wondered how many more lives\\nhe'd lived than I had. I'm picturing him now,\\nasleep in a church awning or over a ventilation shaft,\\nshivering in his jacket stuffed with newspaper\\nas I moan about the LA sun. We're always\\nwriting our own elegies. I just wonder\\nwhich of mine will stick. We take turns holding\\neach other together—quick, hold me close,\\nthe staples in my sternum have warped\\nout of place. Help me find my arms, I lost them\\nback on Aliceanna Street. Once I told a girl\\nshe'd have to fill my lips fast, with a filter\\nor her tongue, or else I'd spill onto the concrete,\\nbut instead of saying I was clever and kissing me\\nshe flashed me a strange look and left\\nto flirt with the bartender. I caught a mosquito\\non my arm and didn't kill it. I watched it drink\\nits fill and fly away.\\n\\n\\nDYSPHORIA\\n\\nAfter Ruth Madievsky\\n\\nSomebody's been peeing into my coffee pot. Somebody's been\\nsmoking all my weed. On lonely nights when the pigeons\\noutside my window are the only company I can get,\\nI think someone injects me with morphine while I sleep.\\nI think I'm dying. I think I think too much.\\nSomewhere between LACMA and the pharmacy\\nI lost my girlfriend, and I want to put up\\nreward posters all across town, but I know I won't.\\nSomeone has set me on fire. Someone put a gun\\nto my head and that someone was me. The city\\nhas become a snapshot of an atom bomb,\\nan imprint of chaotic yes. Every flower\\na firework in stasis. Every gum stain a grave.\\nOn Western and Slauson my friend Wilbur tells me,\\nHere's where my best friend died, nonchalantly\\npointing towards a gutted phone booth, and then\\nhe cracks a joke about teenage prostitutes.\\nSomebody's tapped his phone and he knows it.\\nHe hears the static through the wires.\\nI think death is an apology. I think God\\nwas picked on in grade school. Was it the drugs I take\\nthat drove her away? Am I allowed to ask\\nmy therapist out on a date? I can't wait\\nfor my sadness to turn into anger, my despair\\ninto rage. I still haven't shaken my shadow.\\nOn lonely nights he flicks needles and slides tacks\\nin my shoes.\\n\\n\\nNOTHING (x)\\n\\nRemove the bullet from my head,\\nslide it neatly back into the barrel\\nwhere it will feel more at home.\\nDo the same with the pills\\nand the ice cubes, mould them\\nback into shape in your palm\\nand pretend they never hit me,\\npretend they never propelled me\\nover fences and through airports,\\nalong terrible sidewalks and spines.\\nLet's walk backwards, let's build\\ncell phones that return all the words\\nthey've stolen from us. Pull me out\\nof this party, away from the Tangueray\\nand Prestige. Set me with my back\\nfacing home and give me a sharp push.\\nI'll make it through the barrel\\nof my doorway, the clip of my covers—\\nbetter yet, somebody call up God\\nand tell him, Ok, you win, people are cruel\\nand destroy whatever they touch, and maybe\\nhe'll pull the atoms apart from inside of us,\\nand first there will be the word, and then.\\n\\n\\nHALLELUJAH\\n\\nI hate you, I said to the cat, but more to myself, and I threw him\\nout of my room hoping he wouldn't land on his feet,\\nbut he did. There were mascara stains on my pillow\\nthat I still don't know how to get rid of, or how to explain\\nwhen strangers spend the night. I found a razor blade\\non the sidewalk outside the dispensary but I didn't pick it up,\\nI promise. Instead I called my friend and left a frantic voicemail\\nabout how the sky was transparent, or something equally stupid\\nand meaningless, and the Valium couldn't save me,\\nthe Lithium only slowed me down, so I punched a hole\\nin my right lung and that helped some. It's hard to talk\\nto strangers without imagining them as corpses,\\nor potential lovers who will inevitably ask\\nabout the mascara stains on my pillow. My trachea\\nis a guillotine shifting so slowly I forget it's there.\\nSomewhere it is daytime, and somewhere I am happy,\\nbut not here. Somewhere I'm not hovering over the call button\\nto 911, just to tell them the sky is transparent\\nand it's too hard to be alive. Maybe tomorrow I'll wake up\\nto birds chirping. Maybe the cat will have eaten them instead.\\n\\n\\nAS ABOVE, SO BELOW\\n\\nTwo guys were sawing a rubber band ball in half and as each cord\\nsnapped it pushed the innards outwards, like a fist full\\nof worms, or an octopus swallowing itself. There were whales\\nwashing ashore, too heavy to be pushed back to sea, and\\nthe methane gases inside bloated the corpses so much that they\\nexploded, showering neighboring towns in blubbery gore.\\nSomebody broke into a chicken ranch and killed nine hundred\\nhens with a golf club before stripping his gloves and stepping back\\nout through a hole in the fence. I saw a mother give her young son\\na bloody nose for trying to pocket a Kit-Kat, saying, You know\\nwe can't afford it. It's in Paris and Seattle,\\nLos Angeles and DC: this knack for hiding razors\\nbeneath tongues and laying low, crouching behind Porsches,\\nsidestepping alleys. I used to think I'd get hit by a taxi\\nor choke on a peppermint. Now I'm sure I'll catch a couple bullets\\non my way to the gas station for smokes and a Coke.\\nLast night at a dinner party the birds kept battering the windows,\\nlike maybe they were trying to get in, or maybe they were warning us\\nof something outside. The preacher said this life is a dream,\\ncopping a Shakespeare line, but all my dreams end with monsters—\\ndon't yours? Don't you find yourself atop a building while the creature\\nhurdles flights of stairs just to reach you and stare? On the flight back east,\\nwe hit bad weather and the lady next to me starting convulsing in fear,\\nso I held her hand and calmed her, saying, It'll be all right,\\nwe'll be all right, but in my gut I knew I was trying to turn off the stove\\nin a room full of flames. The month when I went crazy,\\nmy heart was a bundle of rubber cords, an anemone\\nof ventricles, and my fists were beached whales waiting to explode.\\nThere are things in ourselves we try to drown in coffee and vodka,\\ncigarettes and ink, but all my monsters know my name—don't yours?\\n\\n\\nWAIT\\n\\nI'm still waiting for my lungs to collapse\\nand leak smoke, still waiting for these jackals\\nto break free from the cage of my teeth and ravage\\nthe steeples and executive offices, the dumpsters\\nand all who live inside them. I'm still waiting\\nfor my ambulance, for the liquor store attendant\\nto remember my name, for everyone I know to die.\\nStill waiting on that loan installment, still waiting\\nfor my girlfriend to say she loves me and mean it.\\nI've only been hit by one bus and been set aflame\\none time, and the metros are still keeping schedule,\\nthe crackheads are still slinging in the empty lot next door,\\nthe man whose daughter I'm dating is still Googling me\\nand frowning at what he finds. We're all waiting\\non the moon to swallow the earth, because everybody\\nlikes an underdog, and Wilbur is still waiting for me\\nto look him up after all these months. I know a woman\\nwho has bullets for teeth. She sleeps in a doorjamb a block away\\nfrom the university, in piles of cans she's collected\\nduring the day. She's still waiting for Jesus, like my parents,\\nor the bishop, or the devil, twiddling his thumbs\\noutside the temple. We're all waiting for each other\\nto give up the ghost. We're all waiting for someone\\nto teach us how to die.\\n\\n\\nEMERGENCE\\n\\nThe talking heads on the news had breaking coverage\\nof the lady who'd somehow microwaved her own head, but\\nthey didn't seem too broken up about it; they went on\\nto praise a boy who designs bowties despite being stuck\\nin a wheelchair. There's no telling what sneaks around\\nour bedrooms while we sleep—I met a guy on the bus\\nwho said he always opens his eyes slowly upon awakening,\\njust in case, just so creatures have a chance to hide. I saw faces\\nin the chapel organ when I was a kid, in all those screaming pipes,\\nreceiving the hymns we offered and hurling them back\\nlike stones. And the irony of being stoned in a church\\nis not lost on me. Yesterday I refilled my prescription\\nin Wal-Mart and people-watched for an hour. I imagined\\nall the little people piling in their minivans, driving home,\\ncooking dinner, fucking each other, cutting their toenails\\nand calling it a night. Maybe catching the last half hour\\nof the news. Maybe not. I told my father I believed\\nin a mean God and he tensed up. He said, I don't believe\\nthat. I can't, but I recognized the whites of his knuckles,\\nthe way he kept his eyes on the road. The new meds were no good.\\nWhen I saw a severed hand in the recycling chute, I didn't think twice,\\nand then I thought about why I didn't think twice.\\nI dreamed I was being felled like an oak\\nby all the little people with one long saw, and I understood\\nwhy it was happening, so I let it. I dreamed the ants\\nbuilt our houses and left them there for us to find, not so that\\nwe could be happy, but so that we'd have places\\nto slowly kill each other with fingernail clippings,\\nand cheap beer, and love.\\n\\n\\nAPOCALYPSE\\n\\nThis is my hand, this is my fist, this is the sound\\nit makes against cartilage, on the dance floor or\\nin the chapel, and this is the way it cradles air\\nit's too scared to release. So what do we do now\\nthat the foundations of our homes have splintered\\nand the garbage men are on strike? How can we\\ngo on when we keep eating our own fingers\\nin our sleep? I was thinking about how this\\nis probably the end, soon the sky will start falling\\nlike cinderblocks and the sea will boil away.\\nThis is my hand, this is my pen, this is my poem\\nabout the Apocalypse and how maybe it's already\\nhappened. This is the stale gray of the ER\\nand the warm drip of pills down your throat.\\nThis is my therapist, and her cute dimples,\\nand her wedding ring. Mud dauber wasps\\nparalyze spiders and stack them eight or ten deep\\ninside their nests for their larvae to eat once they hatch.\\nThe wasps fold the spiders' legs like Kleenex, in neat\\nlittle piles. I saw that and realized, hey, that explains\\nthe way we've been stacked in our houses and cubicles,\\nin our relationships and in our fragile skulls.\\nThis is depression, this is a prescription, this\\nis the realization that the world will be just fine\\nwithout me. This is desperation. This is a love note.\\nThese are my lips. Those are yours.\\n\\n\\nGHOSTS\\n\\nAn hour before the party, before one hundred ghosts\\nflood my backyard, I'm on the porch picking\\na scab through a hole in my jeans, a splash\\nof wine dusting my beard. At the liquor store\\nI stumbled into one ghost who showed me\\nthe scratch marks I'd left all down her back\\nthe month before. The rows of TV dinners watched me\\nwalk away without saying anything. Los Angeles\\nis a cemetery, every house a headstone,\\nevery skyscraper a mausoleum. Ghosts\\nin our wine bottles, ghosts behind our eyes,\\nghosts boxing in our crawl spaces. Twenty minutes\\nbefore the party, Michael's cat runs away,\\nand he's stumbling around in his underwear, shaking\\na cup of cat food and calling out, Moxie! Moxie?\\nin the kind of voice you use to talk to a baby.\\nHe's either going to break a window or cry,\\nI'm not sure which, but I do know this:\\nfive minutes before the party, a girl walks in\\nwith purple hair, saying, I'm on a lot of meds,\\nas if that explains everything, and I say, Me too, and then\\nfor some reason we shake hands. I'm sure she thinks\\nI'm a ghost, sipping her Pacifico in the back, flirting\\nwith boys by twirling her hair like spaghetti.\\nI expect we'll dig a couple graves tonight,\\nmaybe for strangers, maybe for friends,\\nmaybe for our dead cat, maybe for ourselves.\\n\\n\\nBAREFOOT\\n\\nIn this airplane I'm wondering what it would feel like to fall, to never taste another milkshake, to never again grip gravel between my toes, to never pour myself into the space between your lips the way light falls through clouds, or the way we'll fall, if the pilot's heart or an engine explodes. In my backyard there are shards of glass and sheetrock, so when you're out gripping gravel, you're also tip-toeing through a minefield. Last week it rained three inches after a year-long drought, and all the worms had a field day, dancing on the sidewalk, partying in the driveway, until one got ambitious and started climbing my porch steps. He was slithering up the cement like dew does up a freeway windshield, and I wanted to say, There's nothing for you here, friend, I wanted to carry him back down to safety, but instead I just sat and watched him struggle. And when I went out in the backyard later that evening, I purposely stepped on glass, because I could, and I didn't call to tell you any of this, because I couldn't.\\n\\n\\nNEW YEARS\\n\\nNew Market, VA\\n\\nI'm wide awake, alone again on the porch at 2am, sipping cider and toasting my friends in Paris, Austin, LA, and New York, watching Christmas lights flicker across the street, across the golf course, on down Route 11 and its dusty, lazy sprawl. Breath like steam off coffee, hands like leaves weighed with snow, tongue working mute pleas to absent loved ones, lacking words. My father's in bed, still up, I'm sure, hesitant to come outside because he doesn't want to see the cigarette butt burning my knuckles, or the torn pages strewn in ash. My brother's in Tempe, my grandpa's in the ground, and I'm in half a dozen letters left in my LA apartment, unopened. I'd like to think I've left enough hairs in the spines of books to be remembered, even without a name, like in twenty years some kid will pluck me out of The Brothers Karamazov and wonder who I was, where I came from, and how in God's name I ended up in her hands. For all I know, after death we'll all wander around in bursts of black smoke, but for now I'm here, in the billboards and frost, in the windmills and factory lights, in the paint-flecked windows, warped against the years.\\n\\n\\nAMBULANCE\\n\\nThere was a convex mirror. An altar made of hands.\\nThe traffic shot by like bullets through flesh\\nand you ran out into it. No, you didn't run,\\nbut you wanted to. You kept trying to pry\\nthe bullet out of your chest but your fingers\\ncouldn't grip it. I saw a man with no arms\\npanhandling in Pershing Square and his toes\\nwere limber and thin. I bet that's how you felt\\nwhen you watched the ambulance blast\\ndown Hoover, driving somebody to the hospital\\nafter they slipped in the shower or choked\\non some eggs. There was a squeegee.\\nI burned the hair off my left arm.\\nIt was funny until the flame really caught,\\nlike sparks on dry brush. I heard\\nyou went crazy, I heard you kicked a door down,\\nI heard you crying in the next room over\\nwhile my ceiling fan turned and turned.\\n\\n\\nNIGHT\\n\\nI barked my knuckles on the concrete, the sky\\na film of brake lights and smog, my shoes filling\\nwith my own blood, and you were at the top\\nof the stairs, your body telling you to fall.\\nWe were burning, tired, gutted like trout,\\nbut who was dragging us\\nthrough those alleys and pools? Who had us\\nsnapping fence posts like bones, prying open\\nour pockets for smokes we'd left at home?\\nI want you to know I'm scared. Nine days\\nof corkscrews and sucker punches, somebody\\nchasing us away from the party for ripping\\ntowel racks out of the wall. You had wind\\nin your eyes, a razor under your tongue, and\\nI promise if I could scrape the vodka out\\nof your veins, I would. I limped home\\nand gave myself a black eye. I gave myself\\nto the asphalt, still swept with wine.\\nMy window beckoned, it said, Look here,\\nI know the secret to life after death.\\n\\n\\nBLACKTOP APOLOGIES\\n\\nAfter Larry Levis\\n\\nIt's 2am outside the McDonald's on Fig and I realize\\nI'm watching the moon through the fronds again,\\nmumbling curses to the little man in the crosswalk sign\\nas the street creeps along in frantic slur.\\nI bum around until my Camel dies\\nand wander in, order some ice cream, order some fries,\\norder all this greasy food I don't want but eat anyway.\\nI can't be alone—my stomach's all pills and gin, and if I go home\\nI'm pretty sure I'll drink out of the toilet, or choke on bananas\\nor something as stupid, so I make eye contact\\nwith all the workers and drunk sorority girls pacing the aisles.\\nI must stink because everyone's giving me a wide berth\\nbut it's fine. A homeless guy walks in and he looks like Santa's sad twin\\nso I ask him if he wants anything. Haven't a milkshake in years, he says.\\nI buy him one. He says, You ever jet ski? I did in a dream once.\\nHe looks the way I feel. The homeless guy pays me back with a gold button\\nhe found outside, and I don't know what to say so I shake his hand and leave.\\nA while later I'm perched on the curb writing this poem on the back of my receipt\\nwhen a woman in rags stops her shopping cart full of cans\\nand says, Someday I'll be able to sit down and have a normal conversation\\nwith someone like you. She leaves. I shrug. I wander home and strip\\nbefore I even make it in the front door, and I don't drink\\nout of the toilet, I don't chain smoke on the balcony,\\nI don't tear up this poem and fall asleep holding the scraps.\\n\\n\\nBIRD II\\n\\nMilitant pornstars robed in light, arch-backed\\nand bucking to drum rolls of shutter. Toothless\\nvagrants playing chess on 5th and Hill,\\nthe fruit man carving smiley faces in watermelons\\nas drunk students stumble past. My fledgling doves\\nreturned to my balcony while I was out of town—\\nat least that's the best explanation I have\\nfor the blanket of shit I found\\nsmothering my chair and ash tray\\nand no one else's. I like to think\\nthey came looking for me\\nafter braving Los Angeles\\nthrough window and gust.\\nI should have warned them.\\nThe first time I had a knife pulled on me\\nin South Central I smiled because I didn't know\\nwhat else to do. I was foolish and lucky\\nnot to have been slashed open\\nlike a sack of rice. This is a poem\\nfor those who have cleaned vomit\\noff their friends' favorite shirts—for those\\nwho have watched strangers shoot up heroin\\nand heard threats at the end of a blade.\\nThis is for those who have tried to come home\\nand found that home vacant and cold.\\n\\n\\nPANORAMA\\n\\nBring in all the winos, the skid marks and soles, turn\\nall the crosses upside-down, scoop up the college kids,\\nshuffle them like tarot cards and toss them off the roof.\\nThe night is too young for you to be clutching a toilet bowl\\nand laughing between heaves. Burn your wallet,\\ntake no photos of Solo cups or the pigeons making love\\non the patio, or the clots of hair stuck in the garbage disposal,\\nor even the fingers that will reach in to retrieve them.\\nLose a couple lighters, gain a couple friends, live off McDonald's\\nand coffee for a week while tiptoeing down the coast. Fall asleep\\non the road, don't notice as your tires hit the warning grooves\\nand growl, blast Wu-Tang Clan in cow towns\\nand make farmers shuffle their feet. Forget a girl's name\\nas you enter her bedroom and let her know.\\nGather all the scam artists, all the hippies twisting leaves,\\nusher all the poets into a canyon and wait for the flood.\\n\\n\\nALL THAT WAITS\\n\\nLos Angeles sipping cold beer and warm wine,\\nthe slow clap of plates as diners close their doors\\nand all the high school girls smoke cigarettes\\noutside the bars, pinching their faces. Let's talk about hair:\\nthe feel of it between your fingers\\nbehind a girl's head, over a toilet bowl\\nin her apartment. It's the girl you love.\\nLet's talk about condoms. No,\\nlet's talk about drum solos you smash\\ninto your dashboard as you barrel down streets\\nand listen for your father's voice over the radio,\\ncrooning about your childhood home and the hurt\\nhe left there. You can't fight it, the quick chill,\\nthe air that only leaves your lungs the second\\nyou introduce yourself as nervous. In another city\\nyou might drive ten miles to escape the concrete\\nand watch the stars, but this light won't let you go.\\nAll that waits outside the city limits\\nare an ocean of quilted smog\\nand a book of half-written lyrics\\nyou can't hold or read or see.\\n\\n\\nPARKING LOT\\n\\nNow they're throwing punches and cursing\\noutside my Jeep, as I recline the seat\\nto quietly sip caffeine. No Valium\\ntonight—the police might chase me out\\nfor another trek through sleepless Portland\\nwhere I'll inevitably drive off a bridge when my eyes\\nclench like thighs mid-orgasm. The bars are closing,\\nsending more drunks my way, towards the fight\\nunder Ronald McDonald's omnipotent grin, and one man\\nyells, Now you did it, you broke my nose. The scuffle\\nends. I imagine the blood in the street, like spots\\nin teenage sheets. It will never travel veins\\nagain. It'll muck up the sewer grate\\nand get carried out to sea, along with the rest\\nof us, and when we're all together again\\nwe'll throw our hands up and pray to sharks.\\n\\n\\nVACAVILLE\\n\\nThe devil's beating his wife in Portland. I'm smashed\\nbecause I don't know how to drink socially anymore,\\nand my mind's still in Vacaville\\nwith the teenager who tricked me into driving her\\nhalfway up the coast. She was a runaway,\\na truck with no gravel to break\\nher fall. Maybe I caught her before she slept in a bus station\\nand was found by the police, or a lonely man with pin-ups\\non the inside of his F-150. The light\\nis faltering over the pine trees, and this is my home,\\nthe greenery and showers, the jubilant gloom.\\nNow I'm smoking fancy French cigarettes\\nI pinched off an exchange student, wondering\\nwhose arms she fled, why she hopped\\ninto my Jeep with a heavy rock in her pocket\\nand no plan except flight. Last night I roamed\\nthe streets of Portland for two hours before stopping\\nin a McDonald's lot and nodding off to the dirge\\nof drunk men whose wives wouldn't give them head.\\nThe breeze was thick with vodka\\nand sea foam creeping onto the land, and as I punched apologies\\ninto the steering wheel, she rode nine hours south\\nin handcuffs, staring at the land blowing past.\\nWe drove by a slaughterhouse\\nbefore I knew her real name, and I said, Isn't that sad,\\nand she just turned up the music and picked at a scab\\non her thigh.\\n\\n\\nMARACA FULL OF BONES\\n\\nMidday bus ride back from Skid Row. I pop a Valium\\ndiscretely so the lady to my left doesn't notice\\nbut I'm sure she already knows—she's seen the scar tissue\\ntracing my scalp, the vodka under my eyes,\\nso fuck it, I shake the bottle out in the open\\nlike a maraca full of bones. I'm thinking about Katie and her bangs,\\nher flask she's locked away in favor of pills, my pills,\\nbecause her whiskey couldn't quench the flood.\\nShe's trying to drink the ocean, she's opening up\\nlike a fist after it's been pummeled to pulp.\\nIf I'm going to make it home, Katie has to be there,\\nwith her eyes and arms wide,\\non the lawn, with an iced coffee, a couple new bug bites\\nwhere her skin should be smooth and white. If we're\\ndriving to the ocean, we'll get up and go. No hesitation.\\nNo sorry slurs. Where does the fist go\\nwhen you open your hand? Where did I read that first?\\n\\n\\nBUCKET OF VALIUM\\n\\nWe binged Nightmare on Elm Street and chugged Smirnoff Ice for a week when Katie's boyfriend left her and she needed a place to stay. I had a dream I was in a theater with a bucket of Valium and a bottle of water and everyone asked me to share. A partygoer pulled a gun in the apartment four doors down but I don't know if anyone died. My girlfriend opened my medicine cabinet one night and a shelf full of pill bottles clattered into the sink. She put them back one by one, slowly, and when she came back out she wouldn't speak. Katie moved in with another friend, so I was free again to walk around naked and blast music at 2am. That was during my month-long Smiths binge and I kept expecting my neighbors to knock and ask for a smoke, or maybe a drink, because that's what you do when someone listens to The Smiths for a month, but they just turned up their Lil Jon to drown out the sound. I watched a movie where a woman made a half-assed attempt at suicide, expecting her husband to save her, but he didn't find her in time, he was busy making coffee in the other room.\\n\\n\\nKENNETH, 25, PERSHING SQUARE\\n\\nI found him strung-out off Skid Row, shredded Nikes\\nfalling off his feet. His earlobes were stretched for gauges\\nbut they were empty and loose, hanging there like tire swings.\\nI couldn't look away. The last time he had sex\\nwas with a kid down Figueroa for forty bucks.\\nI'm going home, he said. Home at last.\\nFour years older than me, Kenneth shook his head\\nlike he had water in his ears. Or whiskey. His lobes dragged\\ninvisible hooks. I could see pedestrians walking through them. I thought,\\nhow did he get here, with his dope and sneakers and chipped teeth?\\nHe needed bus fare to get back up the hill, so I palmed him a five\\nand went home to my bed and A/C and coffee maker and fell asleep.\\n\\n\\nMOVIE\\n\\nI liked the part where they almost died,\\nno, I liked when they made out in the pool\\nand ignored the security guard,\\nmy favorite was when they sat alone in their rooms\\non opposite sides of town and practiced\\nkissing the backs of their hands, I liked when one\\nwas rolling joints and the other was shaking\\npill bottles, I thought it was a little odd\\nhow their teeth never clanged when they kissed\\nand they never had any trouble keeping it up\\nin bed, but it sure was sweet when they met\\ntwenty years later at a deli in Santa Monica\\nand couldn't remember a thing.\\n\\n\\nDESERT\\n\\nSome cold-blooded wretch, some flightless bird\\nbreaking mirrors over my head, dressing my wounds,\\nkeeping tally of the hours I spend\\nwriting letters and burning them in the driveway.\\nAll these little bridges left smoldering\\nbetween me and old friends, schoolyards\\nand bars, and bookstores where we're banned\\nfor sneaking burgundy in through the back. I can hear\\nthe train stitching up the land\\nin iron and grime, half a mile\\nfrom my parents' house in Arizona. It won't rain here\\nso anything that's left out will remain\\nuntil it's been stained by the sun.\\nAll the streetlights die at 5am,\\nat 6 the paperboys pitch the news\\nand chug coffee through chapped lips, and I\\nransack the cabinets for needles and thread,\\nthough I don't know what I'm supposed to do\\nwhen everything's back where it belongs.\\n\\n\\nMEDICINE\\n\\nWhere do you go when the empty comes,\\nwhen your body folds in on itself like paper\\nor flame? How many beds have you fucked,\\nhow many walls have you beaten\\nmore to watch your hands bleed\\nthan to reach the other side? There's truth\\nin the bottom of a shot glass, but not\\nany truth I want to know. And these pills\\nonly burn your throat and leave your cock\\nlimp next to the girl you love. They're nothing\\nbut wind caught in capsules, bleach-lined brims,\\nhair caught in ceiling fans. I have searched\\nin cleavage and weed, in temples and sewers,\\nand there's no God in any waiting room.\\nNo love in a trigger. No fear when you're all\\nprescriptions and scars. God is wine\\nsipped from a Styrofoam cup.\\nGod is nothing at all.\\n\\n\\nCOLD COFFEE\\n\\nAnother night of stealing beer from strangers,\\nthis time a graduation party, Jack stomping\\ncircles around the kitchen, and me\\nscreaming about the Apocalypse, because somehow that's funny\\nin a room full of drunks. People are muttering\\nabout the guy commandeering the music to blast\\nBiggie Smalls, and of course it's Rex,\\nsauntering away to cook taco meat in the kitchen,\\nand all is well until we get a noise complaint and the cops\\nfind Jack smashing bottles in the back,\\nso we go home, we pull out old letters and cut ourselves\\non the edges, and we watch porn, hoping\\nnot to see any faces we know. Who sent us this sorrow\\nthat bites our earlobes and breasts,\\nor this haphazard reluctance to go to bed alone?\\nOn my counter someone left a cup of coffee, and it must be fate\\nso I chug it and smash the mug. We were having fun,\\nit was all fun, we were laughing and running and breaking glass\\nuntil we stumbled home to empty beds\\nand couldn't find our tongues.\\n\\n\\nFROM THE GUTTER\\n\\nThe kid across the street is watching TV in his bedroom.\\nI see his window flickering white and blue\\nas the streetlights soak my hair\\nand cockroaches party in the gutter,\\nscrounging for morsels of food. It's eerie\\nthe way they follow you from city to city,\\nmaking faces too small to see.\\nI wonder what the kid's watching,\\nmaybe porn or an action flick, or late night commercials\\nfor food processors. I imagine he's alone\\nbut maybe not. I'd forgotten\\nthe moon's thin grimace, the way words flutter\\nwhen your voice is drowned in wind.\\n\\n\\nMOTORCYCLE SONGS\\n\\nThere's a train across the freeway sobbing\\nand a woman locking her front door\\nas I open a pack of smokes, feeling very\\nout of place. Somewhere in my arteries\\nthere's a pile of trash, a temple\\nno one can see. Somewhere in the desert\\nmy best friend is singing motorcycle songs\\nand mourning the sky that greets us\\nin the Los Angeles dawn. He's loosening\\nhis helmet, he's fighting the things inside.\\nCrickets and birds. Whiskey and ash. In the hall\\noutside my brother's room, I'm wiping my clothes\\nwith dryer sheets. I think it's going to rain.\\n\\n\\nBIG SUR\\n\\nAnother pack of 27s for the road, another cup\\nof shitty coffee to spill all over the upholstery\\nor toss off the cliff. It's me and Youssef\\nblazing through the fog, taking turns 20mph\\nfaster than the speed limit, and here's the spot\\nwhere Kerouac started walking barefoot\\nbecause his shoes were cutting up\\nhis soles—I see him scribbling litanies\\nin his little prayer book, words like razors\\nscattered in the grass. Youssef puts his feet\\non the dash and leaves his seatbelt\\nunlatched, his arm out the window, ready\\nto signal any incoming traffic, Yes, us,\\nhit us, we're the ones you're looking for,\\nour eyes clotted, our stomachs raw meat\\nfrom the moonshine and fries. On the dock\\nwe watch elephant seals ripple across the sand\\nas they search for others to wrestle or fuck,\\nlike cops scoping jaywalkers on Jefferson\\nbecause they have nothing better to do,\\nand right when we're about to hop the fence\\nand do something foolish and brilliant, some kid\\nasks us to take her picture. She seems happy.\\n\\n\\nSPLIT LIPS\\n\\nso much smoke in her blood\\nso much ache in her smile\\nthe day smelled like skunk weed\\nI brought the sutures\\nbut not the gauze\\nshe was headstone font type\\nAfrikaans slang\\nairplane trails\\nbarbiturate theft\\nshe said, I can't make you try\\nI let go of her hand\\nsomeone sneezed on the sidewalk\\nthe clock screamed the time\\nshe was glistening bottles\\nsmashed on the curb\\nscooped up and christened\\nbathed in yellow tape\\nshe put her head in my lap\\nall focus and snarl\\nI'm here, she said\\nreaching for my hand\\nit was a Friday\\nthe clocks were in sync\\n\\n\\nMAKING FACES\\n\\nIn photos and films it's always\\nthe same: waxed brows arch, teeth\\nslip out to reflect the flash. Lately\\nI've been wondering why things\\nwith eyes and mouths are\\nso much easier to love.\\nSome people fuck in public, some\\nsport ink or nose rings, others\\ndrop hundreds on boat shoes\\nand wave their phones in the air.\\nWhen we're at our worst,\\nwhen the erection fails or\\nwe've forgotten our lovers' birthdays,\\nwe stretch awful facelifts and somehow\\nthat makes everything all right. I'd like\\nto think after all the faking\\nI'm still myself. I'd like to think\\nthat's right.\\n\\n\\nPOETESS\\n\\nFor Sari Forshner\\n\\nWrite a poem without cigarettes,\\nwithout mentioning sex\\nor love or the moon. Write for somebody\\nbesides yourself, write someplace other\\nthan a park bench, or your rooftop.\\nWrite from a different place than Lexapro\\nor regret. Write about the night you slept\\nwithout any clothes on and didn’t wake up\\nto the sound of your own voice. Write\\nlike your life doesn’t depend on it, like\\nyou won’t crumple into a pile of words\\nand runny ink. You are not alone\\nas you sip gin on your balcony,\\nmeasuring your grief like slashes in wrists\\nor loops in a noose. I am always hearing your voice\\nas I crave the sunset and mark my arms\\nwith Plath lines in black Sharpie, channeling ghosts\\nfrom the books beside my bed. One night in Paris\\nwe shook hands over promises of medication\\nand living past thirty. You were drunk\\nand I had called you belligerent. I never apologized,\\nso I’ll do it now: I’m sorry.\\nI’m sorry I can’t take the shards\\nout of your chest and place them in mine.\\nI’m sorry I’ll never know how to hug you\\nwithout feeling too tall. Write something sad.\\nWrite out all the things too grim to say\\nand douse the pages in gasoline. I’ll drive up Adams\\nin a car I’ve stolen from a friend, and we’ll laugh\\nuntil the pills are no longer caught in our throats.\\n\\n\\nSAND CASTLES\\n\\nThere's some blood in my mouth—why is there blood\\nin my mouth? There's a kite tangled in the power lines\\noutside my Rehoboth hotel, and dozens of ruined sand castles\\nup and down the beach. They're ruined\\nbecause last night my brother and I went out at eleven\\nwith shovels and flashlights\\nlooking for something to smash.\\n. . .\\nWhen my brother and I\\nfinally got to the beach, out past the taffy shop\\nand the boardwalk, there was nothing to smash.\\nSomeone had already destroyed all the castles,\\nso we got on our hands and knees and built new ones.\\n\""

The sky's rippled frenzy looked like a tree made out of bones, my face felt ready to break. I gathered napkins and fingernails, bobby pins and razors, anything that had once made love to her skin, and I buried it in a haze of vodka and miles. It was not my intention to make such a spectacle of our separation. I did not become the portrait I promised I would. After all the gums and incisors, queasy perfumes, I finally fell into bed with someone else, someone choking on as many ghosts as me. I cut my teeth on driveways and departure dates, empty pool halls and fists full of air, found myself blackout making faces at a disheveled mess in a stranger's bathroom mirror. And if you want to know the truth, none of this matters, I watched myself pull off that curb and have been wandering dreamstates since. Holy shit I love you, holy shit how do I stop. I was one of two grown men crying over a hooker in Minneapolis at 4am when I checked myself, watched my ghosts seethe like smoke, knocked my knuckles on that door we both know not to enter, courting the things we want to feel least, and if I know anything, it's that the human heart is a wasp that feeds whether it's fed or not. Hello darkness, my name is Jackson Burgess. I have said what I came here to say. This brand of self-immolation is only cute and funny for so long before I find myself breathing dirt, it's only worth doing if it gets me closer to myself, closer to her, closer to closing the window and putting these thoughts to sleep.

I promised myself this wouldn't be a poem about how she's in Paris without me, that I wouldn't mention my recurring dream of her knocking back a bottle of isopropyl on the steps of Sacre-Coeur, so instead I'll write about this habit I've picked up of imagining everyone naked and then berating myself for imagining them naked.

It was not my intention to make such a spectacle of our separation. I did not become the portrait I promised I would.

I cut my teeth on driveways and departure dates, autophobia incarnate, found myself making faces and yelling at clouds. And if you want to know the truth, none of this matters, I watched myself pull off that curb and have been wandering dreamstates since. Holy shit I love you, holy shit how do I stop.

Night knocked heads with the streetlamps and their luminescent gloom, until there were no streetlamps—no thick beams lighting our way. You can't see scars in the dark, or eyes, or tombstones, so when I tripped over Donovan Francis I ate the ground hard. I wanted to fight Donovan, to tear up his headpiece and toss it out of sight, and then I wanted to give him a kiss. The poets were getting antsy, they said we were approaching the Black Angel, a marvelous bronze statue time had dulled from luster to ash—they said anyone who touched it was followed by death. August and I soon found her, looming in the snow, her wings unfurled like a great dark vulture. The storm raged. The poets shuffled their feet. August embraced her, closing his eyes, pressing his cheek against the frigid bronze. The only ghosts I know in this town are the ones you meet in dreams—exes stroking your arm hairs, lost friends clapping your back—so I don't know if we were followed out of that cemetery, after we lit the fireworks and danced to the racket, after the poets scattered and left us rubbing our eyes, but sometimes I like to imagine a Black Angel is lurking as I fumble with coasters and sit at the bar—I keep a stool open and sip my beer and wait\",\n",
